The quicker the run, the higher the performer is ranked. Performance in Parkour speed-runs may be regulated through Parkour Traceurs’ basic movement skill capacities given the physical requirements of the event. This study examined what functional movement skills correlate with Parkour speed-run performance. Nineteen male Parkour Traceurs undertook a physical testing battery inclusive of: agility T-test, maximal grip strength test, and maximal vertical and horizontal jumps across several jump modalities. For the speed-run, Parkour Traceurs navigated an indoor Parkour installation. Pearson’s correlation analyses (r) revealed that agility T-test performance showed a significant negative correlation with Parkour speed-run performance, whereas standing long jump and counter movement jump (with and without arm swing) were significantly positively correlated with Parkour speed-run performance. Concurrent with the intrinsically-linked building blocks in the Athletic Skills Model, the data from the present study suggest that performance in Parkour-speed-runs are underpinned by functional movement skills (jumping, running; arm swinging) and conditions of movement (agility), all of which encapsulate elements of basic motor properties (speed; strength). From a practical perspective, the agility T-test, standing long jump, and counter movement jump without and without arm swing can form a basic battery to evaluate the physical effects of Parkour speed-run interventions on functional movement skills.}, doi = {10.1080/17461391.2021.1891295}, location = {Sport and Physical Activity Research Centre, Department of Sport and Physical Activity, Sheffield Hallam University, Collegiate Hall, Collegiate Crescent, Sheffield, S10 2BP B.Strafford@shu.ac.uk.

This review provides an overview of the use of deterministic models in biomechanics research, a historical summary of this research, and an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of using deterministic models. The deterministic model approach has been utilized in technique analysis over the last three decades, especially in swimming, athletics field events, and gymnastics. In addition to their applications in sports and exercise biomechanics, deterministic models have been applied successfully in research on selected motor skills. The advantage of the deterministic model approach is that it helps to avoid selecting performance or injury variables arbitrarily and to provide the necessary theoretical basis for examining the relative importance of various factors that influence the outcome of a movement task. Several disadvantages of deterministic models, such as the use of subjective measures for the performance outcome, were discussed. It is recommended that exercise and sports biomechanics scholars should consider using deterministic models to help identify meaningful dependent variables in their studies.}, doi = {10.1080/14763141.2011.592212}, location = {Center for Neuroscience and Neurological Recovery, Methodist Rehabilitation Center, Jackson, Mississippi 39216, USA. jchow@mmrcrehab.org}, keywords = {}}@Book{Creswell2020,author = {Creswell, John W. and Creswell, J.

This study aimed at comparing the neuromuscular profile of a non-trained group (NT, n = 10) to power athletes practising Parkour (= traceurs, group PK, n = 11), an activity consisting of jumping obstacles mostly in an urban landscape.METHODS: Maximal isometric plantar flexion force (MVC) and rate of torque development (RTD) were evaluated, and neuromuscular function of triceps surae muscles was assessed and compared between groups through the analysis of evoked potentials from posterior tibial nerve stimulation.RESULTS: PK group exhibited higher MVC force (131.3 ± 8.7 Nm) than NT (110.4 ± 9.6 Nm, P = 0.03) and higher RTD (489.1 ± 93 Nm/s) than NT (296.9 ± 81 Nm/s). At a nervous level, this greater performance was related to a greater voluntary activation level (PK: 96.8 ± 3.6%; NT: 91.5 ± 7.7%; P = 0.02) and soleus V-wave amplitude (P = 0.03), and a lower antagonist co-activation (P = 0.02) and rest soleus spinal excitability (PK Hmax/Mmax: 0.32 ± 0.13; NT: 0.58 ± 0.17; P < 0.001). At a muscular level, PK group exhibited higher mechanical twitch amplitude (PK: 13.42 ± 3.52 Nm; NT: 9.86 ± 4.38 Nm; P = 0.03) and electromechanical efficiency (P = 0.04).CONCLUSIONS: The greater maximal force production capacity of traceurs compared to untrained was underlain by nervous factors, such as greater descending command and greater ability to modulate the spinal excitability, but also by muscular factors such as greater excitation-contraction coupling efficiency. The high eccentric loads that characterize Parkour training may have led traceurs to exhibit such neuromuscular profile.}, doi = {10.1007/s00421-018-3868-1}, location = {}, keywords = {}}@Article{Grospretre2020,author = {Grosprêtre, S and Gabriel, D}, title = {Sport Practice Enhances Athletes’ Observation Capacity: Comparing Scenic Change Detection in Open and Closed Sports}, journal = {Perceptual and Motor Skills}, volume = {}, number = {}, pages = {}, year = {2020}, abstract = {Domain-specific knowledge guides our attention and thus influences our perception. Prior change-blindness research has shown that expert athletes can spot meaningful scene changes more quickly than novices, but less is known of whether this expertise is modulated differentially between open and closed sporting activities. We presented 81 individuals (20 gymnasts, 19 rock climbers, 22 parkour practitioners, and 20 control participants) with alternating sequences of images that corresponded to the habitual training landscapes of each group (gymnasiums, rock cliffs, and urban environments, respectively). We included contextual and non-contextual scenic changes to evaluate whether athletes were generally aware of their environments, or whether their observation strategies only targeted sport-related environmental elements. Among these three athletic endeavors, we found that gymnasts were faster at detecting changes in their environment, irrespective of whether or not these changes were contextual to the sports involved. Expert rock climbers presented a domain-specific expertise that was improved even further for contextual changes. Parkour practitioners presented the fastest reaction times in the urban environment and some of the best reaction times for all types of changes. These results confirm that an ability to read the environment is an integral aspect of practice in open-skilled sports, while skills of athletes in closed-skilled sports are more closely related to motor skill repetitions in constant environments. Thus, open skill training may benefit athletes’ guidance of attention. Our finding that parkour practitioners appeared to have developed the widest perceptual abilities was probably linked to these athletes’ extremely wide range of practice environments and with the constant demands of this sport to find solutions in random natural environments that that are not purposely designed for the sport.}, doi = {10.1177/0031512520958232}, location = {EA4660, C3S Culture Sport Health Society, University of Bourgogne Franche-Comté, Besançon, France.

These standards describe what should be included in a research report to enable and facilitate the review process. This publication marks a historical moment-the first inclusion of qualitative research in APA Style, which is the basis of both the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA, 2010) and APA Style CENTRAL, an online program to support APA Style. In addition to the general JARS-Qual guidelines, the Working Group has developed standards for both qualitative meta-analysis and mixed methods research. The reporting standards were developed for psychological qualitative research but may hold utility for a broad range of social sciences. They honor a range of qualitative traditions, methods, and reporting styles. The Working Group was composed of a group of researchers with backgrounds in varying methods, research topics, and approaches to inquiry. In this article, they present these standards and their rationale, and they detail the ways that the standards differ from the quantitative research reporting standards.

Thirteen high-level traceurs (three females) performed in random order and twice eight tests for assessing a total of 23 variables: SPRSA (a typical maximal-speed shuttle run interspersed with four Parkour competition-common fundamentals) and seven established fitness tests, core stability, hand-grip, vertical-jump, long-jump, pull-up, 300-m shuttle run (as a field test for anaerobic capacity), and Leger test. Except for muscular elasticity index of vertical jump test (intra-class Correlation Coefficient model 3,1 [ICC|3|,|1|] = 0.54 [fair]), fitness tests’ ICC|3|,|1|s resulted excellent (ICC|3|,|1|: 0.93-1.00).

A narrative review across miscellaneous academic fields}, journal = {SportRxiv}, volume = {}, number = {}, pages = {}, year = {2021}, abstract = {Parkour is a growing sport that mostly involves jumping, vaulting over obstacles, and climbing in a non dedicated setting. The authors gathered all known relevant literature across miscellaneaous academic fields in order to define parkour with regards to other sports disciplines.Parkour is a lifestyle sport, and as such provides an alternative to mainstream ones, away from strict rules, standardized settings, and necessary competitions. Traceurs (parkour adepts) consider the city as a playground and as an outlet for their creativity, but they also have a strong taste for hard and individualized challenges. They usually train on non specific structures, at ground level. Although their social background is not clear, they are mostly young and male.Traceurs are stronger than recreational athletes, especially in eccentric exercises. However, their endurance skills may be below average. One of the core specificities of parkour is its precision constraint at landing, which turns a standing long jump into a precision jump, regulated on-line so as to prepare for landing. The running precision jump follows the same landing pattern, and its flight phase contrasts with long jump techniques. Injuries, which are not more frequent than in other sports, often occur at reception and on lower limb extremities. This risk is coped with targeting the landing area with the forefoot instead of letting the heel hit the ground like in gymnastics, or with rolling in order to dissipate the impact. Overall, parkour focuses on adaptability to new environments, which leads to specific techniques that have not yet been extensively addressed by the literature.}, doi = {10.31236/osf.io/e5fta}, location = {}, keywords = {}}@Article{Ham2007,author = {Ham, Daniel J and Knez, Wade L and Young, Warren B}, title = {A deterministic model of the vertical jump: implications for training}, journal = {Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research}, volume = {21}, number = {3}, pages = {967–972}, year = {2007}, abstract = {Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, 2007, 21(3), 967-972 ‘K 2007 National Strength & Conditioning Association … A DETERMINISTIC MODEL OF THE VERTICAL JUMP … DANIEL J.
