There we go. Alright, so, yeah, so as the kind of information sheet I sent over said I'm just kind of interested in talking to some parkour coaches out there about how they understand some of the movements that we do in parkour. Bearing in mind how, you know, it's kind of a decentralised sport, you know, it's not like a central organisation or rulebook or something, saying, Hey, this is what this movement is for parkour. And just kind of seeing how people may have learnt the moves, how they coach them, how they understand and things like that. There was something else I was gonna say that was it. Oh, no, no. Yeah. So just kind of having a conversation with people. I guess the first place to kind of start in that case, is just asking what, is the, oh that's right. And so I picked Kong vault, just as like a kind of well known movement to start with. But I guess the, yeah, the first thing to check is, is Kong vault the term that you're familiar with? Is that how you know the movement?

14-participant
Yeah. So I, I learned it as a Kong vault. I am aware of some other terminology, like a monkey vault, that there's some dispute over if those names refer to the same movement, or not, at least in my region. But I know it as the Kong vault. Yeah, that's the that's the term that we call it by. Yeah.

14-interviewer
What, what's the dispute? Do you know? Like, is it what's the other move it might be?

14-participant
So so my understanding is that the kong is sometimes the name used for a movement where you're, you're diving at the obstacle, and you're airborne before your hands make contact. And a monkey, by contrast, is just it's essentially exactly the same movement, but you're not airborne. So you're going like your feet are still planted, and your hands plant. And so you've got like four points of contact, and then you go over it. Yeah, I've never really cared for that distinction that much like nitpicking in parkour. It's all Kong to me, but [laugh]

14-interviewer
Okay. I mean, I guess, you know, you started doing so already. But how would you, how would you describe the movement? In that case, for a Kong vault?

14-participant
In general terms, I would say a Kong is... how do I keep this simple, uh...

14-interviewer
No no, don't worry about that. Go as complicated as you want, it's all good.

14-participant
I would say a vault designed for obstacles, anywhere for, from knee to chin height, where you're hands are the only contact or your body go over sort of in a tucked position, right. I would say that's, that's kind of the best I can do right now. So that, but.

14-interviewer
So if you were if you were going to, like really break the movement down, maybe like the, you know, the takeoff for the movement, if you know, the, you know, the landing how, how are there like common versions of that, are there variations. How would you describe kind of more than just the basic movement?

14-participant
Right. Okay. So just just so that I understand you, right, because you did cut out a little bit. How would I how would I describe like, how would I break apart the movement? You know, like, how would I describe the landing and the execution or the takeoff? The execution of the landing? Correct. And are there commonalities? Okay, yeah. So, yeah, I mean, I would for a student. I mean, I wouldn't really focus on those things too much. I tend to like teaching in a very broad sort of vague sense and let the students figure it out on their own, but I think I mean, if this is what you're asking, I'm not sure if my answer is going to. I'm not sure if I'm answering the right question. But I know the takeoff from two punch where you're, you do a little hop, both feet hit the ground simultaneously, and you use that as the impetus for the movement. Or you can do like a split step or any, any of the many names for like a like a one, two left, right, and you're coming off of one foot and swing the other like the back foot up and behind. I'm sure there are, you know, other other nuances that we can get into but those are kind of the two major categories of entering movement. I'm not sure if you want me to go into like, angles and [unclear]

14-interviewer
Yeah, as much detail as you want to go into, it's, what I'm curious about really is obviously, and a little bit this has been informed by my talking to other people already so far is there's a huge amount of variation that could go into the movement. So what what is it that makes a Kong vault a Kong vault? If there's so much that could chop and change?

14-participant
Right, right. That's, I like that question. That's good. Yeah, you know, I think I would say, for me, a kong, distilled into like, its purest form, right? Like the the most basic components of that movement would be really any vault where your hands are the only point of contact, and there's some form of like, how do I say this, it's, it's, you're limited by, like, regardless of the approach or which foot you go off of, or even if your hands hit at the same time. The core of the movement really is, hands are the only point of contact, generally at the same time, and your body goes through that space. Right? Whether that's at an angle, I mean, just, what is today, Thursday? Just on Tuesday, I was doing Kongs diagonally, where the obstacle itself was kind of at a weird slant. And I couldn't go through in the conventional way. Right, uh, perfectly perpendicular to the obstacle, and so I'm kind of slant. And by virtue of that slant, I wasn't going through that space between my arms perfectly, sort of straight, if that makes sense. Yeah, I don't know. It's, I think it is kind of, in some ways, the tough question, right? Because there's so many different ways to slice it. But yeah, both hands down, body through the space between the hands. Everything else is kind of miscellaneous and contextual. So

14-interviewer
Is it, s it kind of one of those things where you know it when you see it? It's-

14-participant
Yeah.

14-interviewer
It's a little bit open?

14-participant
Yeah. Sorry. Yeah, no, I mean, I think it's very distinctive. You know, I mean, anybody who knows, parkour knows what a Kong vault looks like, whether or not they know to attach the name, kong, right to that movement, just because it's so iconic. And I think, I mean, it would be kind of fun to figure out where where does that recognition break down? Right? How much can you change the Kong before it stops being a kong? Like visually, right, but yeah, yeah, I don't know. I, I'm sorry. What was your original question? I kind of got lost along the way.

14-interviewer
I'm not sure.

14-participant
All right [laugh]

14-interviewer
So it's like, you know, I do want this to be like a conversation. So if the answers lead us off to places, then then that's great. It's all good. All right. So I'm curious, you know, if you were where do you feel like maybe you learnt the movement? Or can you remember learning the movement?

14-participant
Yeah, I can, that's, that's actually a very distinct memory for me. Mainly, because the Kong was the first movement, I think, that I really learned that was really sort of ingrained into, into my way of moving. So I learned the Kong in a public park in, in the city, and it was on a, on a concrete picnic table, right? It was probably like, six or seven feet long, and you know, two or three feet wide. And we started at, oh, how do I say this at the end of one of the tables, so facing down the length of the table. And the the procedure was to plant the hands, like come right up to the edge of the table, right, basically hips on the, on the edge, hands down. And then just to kind of hop up without moving the hands, trying to get the hips as high as possible. And then from there, you know, adding on things like okay, you know, shift your weight into your hands, get the hips up, and then tuck the knees and then just come straight back down. And then from there, you know, hips up, tuck, and then feet land between the hands, just to kind of get used to that, that idea of, you know, pitching forward and moving into this crouched position. And then after that, it was just a gradual process of like, okay, to take a step back, step into it, hop up onto the table, take a few more steps back, get a bit more more than that and see if you can get your feet farther than your hands and then it just kind of builds naturally and then from there. Yeah. You know, running it to dive kongs and is and, and all sorts of different fun things. But that was that was the main sort of mode of instruction for that movement.

14-interviewer
So we're you being taught that by somebody or we just experimenting for yourself?

14-participant
No, no, I was I was being taught by [name], I think I mentioned him in the, in the information sheet. He is kind of like a mentor. That's kind of a good word. I mean, he's, he's known him for, like, the entire time that I've been doing parkour, but he was very definitely like, the, you know, the instructor, the teaching, like figure, right? Just because he'd been doing it, and I hadn't, and so he was like, Okay, here's the movement, do it, you know, do it again, you know, just the classic, you know, do it until you drop, and then, and that's good enough for one day, and then do it again tomorrow.

14-interviewer
Did you, did you find it easy to learn or hard?

14-participant
I remember it. I think it clicked, I would say it was easy. And whether that's a product of just the, like how natural Parkour is as a movement form, or just just that it worked with my like, my, the shape of my body and the way that I was thinking about movement at the time? I don't know. But yeah, you know, it made sense. It clicked, it was not difficult.

14-interviewer
It, slightly, like different to easy, or difficult. Was it scary?

14-participant
No, I don't remember it being frightening. Exhilarating, maybe. And I was aware of the potential for danger, but it wasn't like, you know, ooh I don't want to, like, I'm hesitant to do this, because I'm worried about like, you know, smashing my nose, clipping my shins or something. Because I that, I think, because I knew I could do it. But I've had students who I mean, so many of my students are really hesitant to, to go into a kong and learn it, I think, because it's, you know, people aren't used to moving in that way. And we're not used to the idea of like, you know, I could hit my knees on a corner of a concrete obstacle, or I could, you know, snap my shins in half or, you know, get a concussion or something. And so it's, it can be frightening to move into that realm of, you know, moving differently.

14-interviewer
It's interesting, because you mentioned it felt, felt natural when you were learning it. But then you mentioned that other other students have found it difficult, or a bit more intimidating because it wasn't something that we're used to doing. Do you think it is like, a natural human movement? Or is it something we have to learn to do?

14-participant
I think, you know, I've spent some time thinking about that, actually, just on my own, and I think it is a natural movement. And I would, I would even propose that every movement in Parkour is natural, right? That if you if you take a human being and you put them in whatever environment and you say, okay, move, right, get from A to B, and you don't tell them how, and they have to learn how to do it. I think I think it would be natural, and I think you would see the same movements, evolving and growing, you know, the same that the way that we've seen them evolve and grow in parkour. It's, I think, the the apprehension and the fear comes in, especially for newcomers, when you know, we live in a society where this sort of movement is, its people are not given the opportunities to, to discover it, right? Because it's a discoverable thing. It's not always something you need to teach. Because people don't know how to do it. They don't know how to do it, because they have not had the opportunities to do it themselves. If that makes any sort of sense, whatsoever.

14-interviewer
There's not a reason for someone to kind of naturally stumble over it in-

14-participant
Right.

14-interviewer
-kind of modern day to day life.

14-participant
Yeah, you know, we're, you know, people are busy, you know, walking to work or taking escalators and, you know, children are told, ah you know, get down don't, you know, don't climb on that don't jump, you know, you'll get hurt. And it's, it's such a stark contrast for me, because I grew up in, you know, the northern backwoods of Vermont on a farm so I was climbing trees and walking over logs and jumping off everything that I could see, you know, and so there wasn't really that like, conceptual restriction on movement, you know, it wasn't just like, walk or sit down or climb in the appropriate areas, you know. And so, I mean, I remember finding some of these movements in parkour like that we see in parkour just on my own like, I found those movements. And I didn't know that it was part of a discipline that was, you know, larger than that. I thought it was just something that I was doing. That's, that's why I find it's definitely like, natural, you know?

14-interviewer
What, what kind of uses would the Kong vault, lend itself to?

14-participant
Hmm. Okay, so as far as I mean, traversal goes, I, pretty much anything, I would say. Particularly, it's good for clearing obstacles of a certain height. So if you need, like, if you have a lot of forward momentum, and you need to just direct that movement up on something that you're not going to, you know, run up or climb up otherwise, that's, it's good, I think, because you've got your hands up here, right, the upper segment of your body, so you can reach up, you know, kind of pull yourself up. Yes, and get over without losing too much. Yeah, too much momentum, also distance. So whether that's, you have an obstacle that is long that you need to travel over, so you can dive into a kong from one end or the other, right, closer end or the farther end? Or you can, I would say, if there's a gap between two obstacles, you know, that you for whatever reason, maybe the environment is set up such that you can't do a running jump, or the obstacles efficiently, like, hop up and run on done. You know, you kong from one over the gap to the other. So, kind of standard stuff, I think.

14-interviewer
And say, compared to some of the other vaults that we might use in parkour how, does it, how does it compare to some of the more common ones in there, there, is it, I dunno, faster? I mean, you mentioned distance, is that like, a really standout feature of it?

14-participant
I think it does, at least for me, I think of the kong as being a movement that's good for covering distance moreso than something like, like a dash vault, right? I think, you know, I feel like it would be harder to get the same amount of distance that you can get from a Kong vault out of a dash, right? Maybe because, like, if I had to break it down, I think, because the Kong is more, more immediate, maybe that's not the right word, but like your, the continuation of your energy is unbroken, right, you've got a run up your hands plant, and there's no break in that in that. Okay. [connection cuts out, on resumption] Yeah.

14-interviewer
Okay. Sorry about that.

14-participant
No worries, it's okay.

14-interviewer
I dunno kind of why, I don't know why Iit just decided to give up. So yeah, I'm sorry, that that cut off pretty much at the beginning of your answer to my last question. So if you don't mind repeating yourself, please.

14-participant
So your question was, you know, does the does the kong vault lend itself to something like distance over other movements? I think essentially. Yeah, you know, the, I would say the kong vault lends itself towards distance in particular, over something like, like a dash vault or even a speed or like a step vault or something. Because the, how do I say this? I struggled with it in the other answer too. Um, the, the energy of you are, well really your your energy is unbroken, right? Where so for like, like a dash vault, right, you have to jump, and then the push is an afterthought. And so it's not really you're not generating much distance, right? You're not, you're not going very far. But with a kong, you've got, man, how do I phrase this? The trend, like the conversion of your, like your run up to the push on the obstacle. There's, there's almost no break between them. So it's, you have a continuous sort of transfer of that energy? I don't know. That's, maybe that's the best I could do. It feels very unclear to me. I wish I could answer that more eloquently.

14-interviewer
No it's good. But how about when it comes to like connecting it to other movements? Is it is it good for that? Is it or is it quite difficult?

14-participant
Depends on how you do it. If you're, sorry about that, if you're if you're doing a kong for distance, or height, you know, you're probably not going to be able to link it very efficiently to other movements. If your goal is to like, you know, turn very quickly or, you know, go back or do something else. In general? I don't know, maybe I want to change my answer, because I was thinking, in general, it does kind of, you can do other movements into a kong very easily, you can do movements out of a kong very easily. There's a good combo that my friends and I like to do to Kong, directly into a step vault. You know, I've seen that. Like, I know, that's not a unique thing to do. But it's a good example of, you know, you can do a kong, and before you land like you're landing out of the Kong is another movement, or another vaults or, you know, a kong to an underbar or something. So, it's yeah, I would say it's versatile enough that it lends itself to transitioning between movements very well.

14-interviewer
Does the, does the upper body play much of a role on the obstacle itself? Or is it all coming from that takeoff? In terms of-

14-participant
Ooh. Good question. Yeah, it's such a debate. Well, it depends. I think it really all, like everything else in parkour, it depends on the context, right? What are you trying to do? What is your environment like? You know, what's, you know, are you are you comfortable with Kongs or not? I think, really, you can get your power. And like the man, how do I say this? The role of like your upper body in a Kong versus your lower body in a kong, right, or where you generate that power? It depends on who you are, I would say and what you're trying to achieve. So there was a period of time in my training, where I was generating power from my Kongs almost exclusively, from my lower body, through, you know, the, I would take off my left foot, and swing my right foot, up and back behind me, right, as hard as I could. And I would use that to generate the lift from my hips, and my hands were just there to guide me through. And then there have been times in my training, where I was not focusing on swinging the leg, and I was getting all of my power or most of it from the push, slash pull with the hands. I mean, ideally, I think, I mean, you can get power from both, and I wouldn't say that it's preferable for, to generate power from your upper body versus your lower body. And I wouldn't say that it's necessarily even one plays a larger role than the other. It's, which one, which one allows you to be most effective in your movement? Right. So for someone, maybe, you know, I train with some, some of the people I train with are women, right. And they tend to develop power in kongs through their lower bodies. Right. Whereas I think, like I said, I played around with it before, but I like to generate power with my upper body. So yeah, it depends. That's the short answer. It just depends.

14-interviewer
I guess maybe a better question might have been, can the upper body contribute to the movement?

14-participant
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's, you know, I think just just by virtue of the fact that your only points of contact are your hands, there has to be some involvement in the upper body. It's not for generating power, just to, you know, just to do the movement, which we've established is, you know, in some form or another relating to the placement of the hands on the obstacle.

14-interviewer
And when you're kind of coming out, on the other side of the obstacle, is there a certain way you want to be like, exiting the movement as well? Or...

14-participant
Yeah, let's, okay, let's assume you're on flat ground, you're not going to, like you're not intending to go into any other movements. You're just konging an obstacle. Land on your feet. [laugh] That's generally the best bet for beginners. Yeah, land on your feet. You can land in a precision, right with feet together, and stop. You can land on one foot and keep going. It's, I don't know. Like if you're if your question really is just, is there any, any way that you should want to be landing out of a Kong? Land on your feet. Everything... You know, details.

14-interviewer
Good advice.

14-participant
Yeah.

14-interviewer
I guess, what I might be curious about is, you know, particularly when you're coaching what might you be looking for in terms of like, oh, that was a that was a good Kong vault or a bad Kong vault. Or I might like to improve this in a student or anything like that. You know, there are there certain things you like to look out for, or signs of quality or success?

14-participant
Right, right. Yeah. Okay. A quick aside, before I answer that, I want to say I really appreciate your questions. You've got some fantastic questions here.

14-interviewer
Thank you.

14-participant
Yeah, you're welcome. Yeah. So when I'm coaching, it's funny, just the last two weeks, I've been coaching a woman on Kong vaults specifically. And she's a total beginner, so pertinent right [laugh] So what I look out for, really, in general, is, first and foremost, are they are they approaching the movement properly? So are they you know, placing their hands in the correct way with their thumbs flat? Not, you know, not like this? Are they... You know, are they approaching with enough speed? Are they confident in their ability to actually go over the obstacle? You know, just just I think just because of the way that I like to coach people, I prefer to give not a lot of direction to the student, and then kind of refine the movements with them. So, you know, show the movement, explain, basically, okay, put your hands like this go through. And at that stage, what I'm looking for is just to work with, with the fear or the apprehension that might be there. So that's, that's the first thing that I look for, like progress for success in Kong vault is, are they able to like are they in the right mindset, to be able to approach the Kong and really work on the technique? Because if you're fearful, you're going to hold yourself back. Right? And that's not what you want for developing, you know, fast, strong approaches for the Kong vault were a long dive into the movement or anything like that. But apart from that... yeah, the feet, I think, how do I, uh, English. How do I say this? Maybe I maybe it's not that I look for certain things. Just that I note certain things, and that's kind of an intention, like, I will pay attention to, does the student prefer to take off from one foot or out of a punch. And I'll use that to sort of cue myself, to cue them properly. So if they already tend to want to dive into it out of one leg, then I'll focus with them on that technique, and developing a single leg take off. Or if they prefer to punch, then I'll develop the punch with them. But the most important things are just really confidence, I think, in the approach, proper hand placement, and then the exit really takes care of itself. I find I don't have to do that. People naturally figure out how to land out of movements properly. So is that kind of what you're looking for?

14-interviewer
Yeah, that's great. I'm aware as well, that, you know, there's always going to be, you know, individual, you work with individuals, you know, but I guess it's just kind of like, maybe things that come up regularly, or common things or stuff that you've just noticed, like, ah this is good to try and get across to someone when they're learning it. Right?

14-participant
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. You know, it's for me, it's definitely, definitely all about like, the, the internal approach, right? Yeah. Are they apprehensive? How apprehensive? Are they what's causing that apprehension? You know, are they worried they're going to clip their feet? Or are they worried about, you know, something else? Like, you know, speed or power? Are they not sure how to place their hands? So, I don't know. I think that's that's kind of what I like to focus on mostly with the coaching.

14-interviewer
Is that with the Kong vault, you think maybe, because there's a, quite high degree of like commitment to the movement, you know, you have to dive headfirst basically, and particularly when you start getting more powerful with it, like you mentioned.

14-participant
Yeah.

14-interviewer
It can be a little bit intimidating to people?

14-participant
Oh, absolutely. Yeah. I mean, it's, you know, I think, especially for newer students, you know, even if they come from movement backgrounds. It might feel a little bit like asking someone to, you know, do a swan dive, a kong pre. Okay, just run and dive headfirst and, you know, just trust your body and what do you mean trust my body? You know, I don't know how to do this. So, yeah, I think it's, it can be probably one of the most intimidating movements. Now for some people, depending on, you know, their inclinations. But yeah.

14-interviewer
So if, um, so, it's quite, you know, we've talked quite a bit about the Kong vault, kind of defining it a little bit. Not defining it, but you know, just talking about some of the details of it. I'm curious if that's, is that kind of reflective of what you learnt when you learnt the movement? Or has that evolved over time? Perhaps as you moved into coaching? Have you updated that in some way? Or is it pretty consistent with how you first learnt it?

14-participant
Maybe I think, could you either repeat that or rephrase? I know, I'm just-

14-interviewer
Yeah. Like, how you've come to understand the movement or how you teach it someone else? I guess, you know, do you coach it to other people the same way that you learned it, is one way to put it?

14-participant
Right. Um. No, not really. I've, I've definitely, I think developed my own, you know, a way that I like to coach people that differs from the way that I learned things, in some regards, I mean, I learned very, very definitely, sort of, by way of just like, keeping up with people who are better than me right. It wasn't even a class structure. It was just like, okay, I met these people, they say, come train, you know, keep up word or leave, you know, basically, and, and I like to keep that sort of dynamic, that sort of mentality in my training, just to make sure that I have serious students, but for the Kong vault, I mean, I will, I will take some students through, you know, put your hands on the table, get your hips up tuck and whatnot. But apart from that, I mean, it's it's, I don't know, there's not like one way that I like to teach it. I like to let the student dictate how I teach, and not the other way around, right.

14-interviewer
Do you- Sorry, carry on.

14-participant
No, I just, I was commenting on on the broadness of the answer.

14-interviewer
Do you, like, discuss anything about this, like with other coaches? Or do you have any resources you drawn for your coaching? In terms of teaching skills?

14-participant
Yeah, yeah. And I, so I, train and coach and interact a lot with Sean, the guy that I learned from, my mentor, friend, whatever. So he and I have a lot of these discussions. There aren't any, like, as far as like books, or videos, or online articles, or anything that I don't really draw from many of those. Just because it's, there's nothing more to draw from, really. But yeah, I don't know. I mean, it's how do I say this, like the the discussions that I have with other coaches about, you know, how to teach the kong, or, you know, what are some common traps that students fall into? it? It's not, those discussions are not undertaken with the the intention of like refining our ability to coach, it's just there to talk about. Yeah, no, no.

14-interviewer
Do you think that you know, something, something like that might be helpful to coaches, something that says, hey, here's a good way to teach the Kong vault, having some some guidelines and help out there for coaches?

14-participant
Yeah, I think it certainly couldn't hurt. You know, I think if you're, if you're new to coaching, or even if you're experienced an experienced coach, but you're just looking to draw on other resources. If you're, you know, if you want to experiment with a new way of coaching, or maybe you've run into kind of a difficult point with, you know, teaching it to a certain group or a certain person, then yeah, I think that would be beneficial. I can't see any reason that it would be a negative thing, really, except, except if it attempts to sort of proclaim a proper way of teaching. And that's something that very sort of, I would be appalled at actually you know, if someone were to say, Okay, this is like the way to teach, and you cannot teach it any other way. This is the proper way. That's that goes against the entire spirit of parkour. Right, that goes against, you know, all of the all of the foundations of the discipline. So that would be very upsetting for me to see that, you know, yeah, I think just an opening. Here's some ways to teach it. Some ideas, some practices. Yeah, that would benefit everybody.

You, you preempted my next question, which was going to be exactly that, whether that clashes with the spirit of parkour for want of a better word, you know, like, Okay, cool. Um, I forgot what I was going to ask... We've actually covered an awful lot of the points I like to try and get to with people, which is, which is really good. It's, you've been very concise, which is good. I guess, really, I'm curious as well. Is there anything about the Kong vault that you might yourself be curious about? Or you feel that maybe you don't understand that you'd like to know more about?

14-participant
I'll have to, I'll have to think about that. Just because I don't know. It's, it's funny, I feel like, there's not really a whole lot of like mystery or curiosity about the movement itself. For me. It's that curiosity lies more in the application of the movement. And I don't know, you know, how much of a line you want to draw between those two? But I mean, I guess the short answer is no, not really. I feel like it's, it's as natural as breathing to me at this point. And so that question feels a little bit like, you know, is there anything you're unclear about on your breathing, you know, anything unclear about anything, you're curious about the way that you, you know, eat food or drink water or something? So I'm like, Well, no, not really. But I'm curious about, you know, like, the types of foods that are out there. And, you know, it's kind of a weird analogy, but, yeah.

14-interviewer
I get what you mean.

14-participant
Yeah.

14-interviewer
It's, you know, I think I said at the start, you know, I picked it because it's quite a well known movement. Do you consider it something that, you know, is important for people coming to parkour to learn? Is it like a staple movement?

14-participant
It's, okay, it's a staple movement only because people think it's a staple movement. I would argue there, there is no such thing as a movement that, you know, people should learn, that is parkour. Right? I don't, I wouldn't even say that Parkour is like, you know, these movements, right. It's just movement period. So, no, right. It's, I would teach a Kong vault, to a student. And let them know, look, this is a very well known movement, if you haven't heard of it already. It's called this it's got this history or whatever. Really, only because that's been established. Right. But I don't hold any movements to be essential to the practice, right. Like it's none of them are the identity of parkour. Right. Parkour is the reason behind the movement. Right, and the application of the movement, that's parkour. Yeah.

14-interviewer
What I find interesting is that, you know, a lot of people have that mindset. But there's still evolved, you know, parkour movements that you know, we've, we've given them names, and I said, kong vault and you know what I meant. So it's that weird clash between these things kind of have grown up as capital P parkour techniques-

14-participant
Yeah [laugh]

14-interviewer
-In a sport that is very much about being free and open.

14-participant
Yeah. Yeah, totally. You know, it's, it's interesting, because that's one thing I really, really tried to sort of instil in my students is an appreciation of, like, these movements, you can say that they sort of belong to parkour, but these movements themselves are not what Parkour is. You know, it's, it's like, learn the movement, learn the name, learn the history, but don't let that become everything that Parkour is.

14-interviewer
Right. Do you find that- Sorry, carry on.

14-participant
I was just gonna sort of add a little point about you know, just like learning to distinguish between like the the individual techniques, and really the the broader sort of, yeah, like the broader spirit of parkour, what it means to do, yeah.

14-interviewer
Do you find that people come to the sport, you know, beginners or whatever, and they know what the Kong vault is? Is it kind of a little bit famous now?

14-participant
Yeah, yeah. You know, it's, yeah, I know. So many of my students, especially young kids, right, like, you know, 10, 11, 12 year olds, they come to class, they're like, okay, you know, I know, all these movements. I know, the names. You know, I practised at home on my couch or whatever. And, and people think that they know, you know, what it is, and they think they know how to do it. And even if they've practised, it's like, okay, yeah, whatever. It's, I think that kind of, can hinder a lot of the real learning a lot of the deeper level learning that can take place with students who have no idea what Parkour is, they've never even heard the word. Right. Yeah, it's, it's, it's an interesting phenomenon, right? It's popular. And the image that parkour has now in the public mind, is so far from, you know, the, like, the original discipline, it's just totally, no, not even comparable. And, and so it's, you know, like, the number of students that I've had to sort of explain, like, Well, look, you know, you know, the whole, like, you know, flips in parkour or not, you know, and I'm not gonna comment on on that one way or the other right now, I think, but, yeah, it's, it makes it difficult to teach when people come with preconceived ideas of what they should be learning.

14-interviewer
I'm curious, you know, if, with this kind of philosophy for it, you know, because, you know, generally, if you're going to teach something to someone, you kind of have to know what it is to pass it along. So, you know, taking the Kong vault as a really good example. It's such a broad collection of movements almost.

14-participant
Yeah.

14-interviewer
...With some commonalities. Like, how do you think that's kind of come about, is that just kind of like, as a community, just people of over time, put these things together?

14-participant
Yeah, you know, it's a good question. I don't know. I mean, you're, you're right, that, you know, you have to know what it is to teach it. And so, you know, if a student comes to me and says, Hey, I want to learn the Kong vault, and I say, ah there's no such thing. Kong vault is just a term, and we've got this, you know, a bunch of these movements that are kind of related. That's not going to do anybody any good. Right. So it's, yeah, it's, it's interesting to see how these things have evolved, though, like, you go from total, totally free sort of movement to, you know, movements with names to movements with specific attributes to, you know, combinations of movements, when before it would have just been, you know, no names, just, you know, just that progression.

14-interviewer
I think... I think, you know, we've covered a lot here. Is there anything that's kind of popped into your head at any point, or you thought of that we didn't get to or anything you just like to add?

14-participant
Okay, maybe, I don't know. I mean, I could talk forever and ever and ever and ever about, like, you know, like, you know, the spirit of parkour, the original discipline or why it's important to learn the history and stuff. But I feel like that might be a little beyond the scope of your, what you're talking about here.

14-interviewer
Yeah, I'm trying to try to keep it to the Kong vault a little bit. Yeah. Yeah.

14-participant
So no, nothing really. Okay. Cool.

14-interviewer
Let me just do another quick check through all my questions in that case. Yeah, I think I think we're good.

14-participant
All right. Awesome.

14-interviewer
All right. I will I will just stop the recording and that case.

14-participant
All right.
