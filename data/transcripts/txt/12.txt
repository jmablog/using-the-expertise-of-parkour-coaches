12-interviewer
All right. So yeah, so the study is, is basically just try me, I'm trying to go out and talk to a bunch of parkour coaches about how they kind of understand the movement and coach it, and maybe how they'd learnt it and stuff for themselves. Considering that, you know, we kind of have this decentralised sport where there isn't a central organisation or rulebook or guideline or something, saying, This is what a movement is. So I'm just really trying to kind of talk to people and see how they have, they've kind of built that understanding for themselves, or within the community. I just kind of picked the Kong vault as a kind of well known movement, and like a good choice to start with. So I guess the first thing to kind of check is, is Kong vault, you know, does that sound familiar to you?

12-participant
Yeah, it is. I would say that's probably one of the first vaults that I learned, starting out. And it's one of the most commonly used ones too I'd say, in, you know, any parkour gym.

12-interviewer
And I guess, kind of just, in your own words, how would you, how would you describe the movement?

12-participant
So, just step by step, I'd say that approaching an obstacle, you would jump with sort of your chest down, and arms, about shoulder width apart, hands on top of the obstacle, your hips up, knees bent almost to your chest, and you just carry your legs through the vault. And through your hands. And, yeah, and then just step out of it.

12-interviewer
Are there, um, and are there like, particular ways that you take off for the movement?

12-participant
There's, there's two ways there's, you know, like a punch with your feet together, and then you step into it, I would say I step into it more than a punch, unless I'm doing maybe a double Kong or a dive kong.

12-interviewer
Is there a, is there a difference between those two kind of approaches?

12-participant
Yeah, so a dive Kong is, when you do sort of a longer jump, the obstacles a lot larger, so you're going over a longer distance. So you're, you're diving through the air, hence the name, dive kong, to get over, you know, a longer obstacle and with a double Kong, you are placing your hands down at two separate points. So they go down for the first kong, but your body is still in the air, you don't carry your knees through. And then while you're still going over the obstacle, you place your hands down again, and then bring your knees through.

12-interviewer
And you mentioned like the punch takeoff, and the kind of staggered feet, takeoff, kind of two foot. What did, how do they kind of change your takeoff?

12-participant
I would say with a punch, you get more power. So a lot of beginners are going to use punch more to get more height. Especially when you're when you're first learning Kong vault, you're going to want to get a lot more height to carry your, your legs through. So um, yeah, if, like when I was beginning, I used to punch a lot, but now I'm more used to the movement. So I do the staggered step into it. And it's a lot easier, it just flows better. Especially if you're running right at the obstacle, you don't have to take a hop into the punch, you can just step into it.

12-interviewer
Does it make a difference to to the movement as a whole? Does it change things about you know, how you how the rest of the movement takes takes place? Or is it just kind of, it's easier to run into?

12-participant
I would say it's just easier to run into.

12-interviewer
And so you know, you mentioned dive, going forward onto the hands. Are they contributing to the movement as well or are they just kind of tapping the obstacles you go past?

12-participant
Um, on a regular Kong and a dive Kong, you will be taking a lot of impact on your hands. Because you know you're just you're placing your hands down once, but in a double Kong, when you place your hands down the first time is just going to be usually a soft tap, maybe a little bit of push to give you more height. And then the second time you put your hands down you're gonna be taking all the impact and so, um, yeah, I would say just mostly, most Kongs are just going to have one soft tap, maybe a little bit of push to carry you over [unclear]

12-interviewer
So as most of your kind of power in the movement coming from the, from the legs from the jump beforehand?

12-participant
Yeah.

12-interviewer
Yeah. And how about coming off the other side of the obstacle? Is it, is there a particular way to come out of the movement as well?

12-participant
Yeah, best way's to step out, but a lot of beginners, you know, when they land, they're gonna kind of stutter, they're going to not be used to the impact so that their knees might bend or fold a little. And that's, you know, typically when they're chest comes back, that awkward landing, but the more you get used to it, the more you'll, you'll realise that you know, your, your chest is down the entire way through. So when you land, your momentum is carried forward, and your balance is kept by keeping your chest low.

12-interviewer
Is that important? Coming out the movement, that balance?

12-participant
Very important, yeah, especially if you are going into something right after a kong.

12-interviewer
Is that common to kind of connect it up with other stuff, or...?

12-participant
I would say so yeah. Usually, especially in an urban environment, you're gonna want to connect it with something, you know, there's one wall, there's bound to be more, so.

12-interviewer
Mm. You mentioned like, you know, dive kong and double Kong and stuff. Do you kind of consider these like, distinct moves are they or are they all just kind of variations on the same movement?

12-participant
I would call them all variations. And, you know, they are they are all kongs. But there's, you know, a tonne of different kongs you can do, you can do if a 360 Kong, which is where in your movement while diving towards the kong, you rotate your body a complete 360 degrees and then kong through, you can do a Kong gainer, which would be to Kong vault, but then going right into a backflip after by just using your hands. So yeah, there are tonnes and tonnes of variations on.

12-interviewer
What, what's kind of like, the common common thing shared between these variations, like what makes something a kong versus giving it a completely different name?

12-participant
The defining quality of a kong would be placing your hands down about shoulder width and carrying your knees through. [unclear] there's any other vaults like that, that are called kongs.

12-interviewer
Is it a little bit kind of, you know, when you see it, it's...?

12-participant
Yeah, I would say so. I'd say, when you see a kong, you're gonna say that's a kong or some variation of a kong.

12-interviewer
And so I'm curious, you know, you said, I think at the start, that was one of the first moves you learnt, did you teach yourself? Or did you have, go to classes or anything like that? How did you kinda learn it?

12-participant
Um, I started in, in my backyard, just, you know, looking at parkour videos on YouTube. And I wouldn't say that I was actually doing parkour then I was just kind of sort of building up to it. And then I started going to a gym, about 20 minutes away from me. And that's when I started learning more official, clean forms and techniques.

12-interviewer
How did you, what kind of things did you kind of learn about the movement, going from self taught to, I guess, what were you taught about the movement? Was there anything that sticks out? Or...?

12-participant
Yeah, I learned control a lot more. And like I said, earlier, I learned that, you know, there's different ways to approach it. There's different ways to come out of the vault. And there's tonnes of variations that I've learned on it. And I'm still learning more even six years later.

12-interviewer
Did you find it easy to learn or difficult?

12-participant
In the beginning, it was pretty easy, especially in the gym I was in it was, um, it was newly parkoured gym. It started at first as a gymnastics gym. So there were spring floor mats everywhere. So it was a very safe environment. But yeah, as I learned more variations, I would say it definitely got a lot harder.

12-interviewer
So is it like a movement, you can you can progress to quite advanced things?

12-participant
Yeah, yeah, you can, you can start with, you know, the regular Kong vault, and then you can experiment with that, put it into lines, try variations of it, things like that.

12-interviewer
Is it, is it quite like a useful vault, in general? I know, it's quite a broad term but, you know.

12-participant
Yeah I would say, yeah, it's probably maybe my go to if I'm not thinking about it, if I'm at a certain speed, like, I'm going pretty fast, too fast to do something comfortable, I'm probably just going to use a kong vault.

12-interviewer
And is that just because you, you're very comfortable with it? Or do you think it just applies itself to a lot of situations?

12-participant
Um, probably both, I'm very used to it, it's a comfortable move, and it can be applied to any situation where you are just going in a straight line, you are needing to go straight over that obstacle, your best bet will probably be kong vault.

12-interviewer
In comparison to like other vaults commonly used in parkour, it's, it's just very, um, particular fast, or efficient, or...?

12-participant
I would say it's a combination of efficiency, and speed. So vaults like a dash vault, where you you jump up, and you kick your feet out, before your feet or before your hands touch the obstacle, that has a little bit more danger to it, a lot more speed. But with a Kong vault, there's an element of safety where you, you can always keep your feet under you if you mess up so you can catch yourself. And your hands will always be out in front of you.

12-interviewer
Do you find, the, I mean, just because you mentioned safety there [cough] Excuse me, do you find it, when you're coaching it now, is it a movement that people, you know, learn pretty easily or are they, do they find it difficult at all?

12-participant
I would say most people find it generally easy to get down sort of, a, once you get over the feeling of it, get used to it, it just becomes natural. But it also depends on the size of the obstacle, how tall or even how short sometimes it can be difficult to Kong vault over a smaller obstacle. So it sort of depends on...

12-interviewer
So it depends on the the individual and the environment where they're learning it. Sorry, excuse me one second [cough] Sorry. I've been doing a lot of talking today and my throat, I think my voice is starting to give up. Okay, do you find when people you know, come to classes and stuff that it's it's a movement they've already know, as beginners they've seen it somewhere else, or?

12-participant
Well, in my particular gym, most of the people coming there are relatively new to the sport, they don't really have a lot of experience. And usually they're they're younger too sort of 10 to 16 years old. So they have little to no experience in vaults. And generally they just want to get right to the flips. They want to learn how to do that. But typically, they they're not going to really know how to do it. So they have to learn first.

12-interviewer
What about, do you coach any adults or older, like teenagers as well?

12-participant
Yeah, briefly, for some time, we had some adult classes at my gym. We weren't getting a lot of attention, the adults not not many going into classes so [unclear]

12-interviewer
Ok. And I guess the reason I kind of asked those kind of questions is I'm curious whether it's kind of become a bit of a famous parkour move, like if people recognise it as parkour ,I don't know, do you think it's a recognisably parkour movement, or is it-

12-participant
I, I would say that if you have been doing parkour for at least... at least like a year, you're probably going to recognise it. You know that that comes to the difference between parkour and freerunning where a lot of people say, oh, they're the same thing. And then you have typically more traditional people who say Parkour is mainly flips, people like that are going to recognise a Kong vault, much more than someone who's say strictly does freerunning [unclear] recognisable.

12-interviewer
Do you think it's, it's quite like, erm, I don't want to say like, important, but like, is it, is it something that you would encourage people com ingto the sport to learn? Is it like, not important, what's the word, like useful movement for people to learn?

12-participant
Yeah.

12-interviewer
Like a fundamental movement?

12-participant
Yeah, I would absolutely say that it's fundamental. It's one of the basics, everybody should learn it in the beginning. Even even if you don't want to, it's just a good one for the repertoire, even if you're not going to use it a lot. Because having that skill, just even a basic Kong can translate into other skills like a kash vault, which is the combination of a dash vault and a Kong vault, where you start like you would a Kong vault, and then kick into a dash. Obviously important to do that you're going to want to learn how to do a kong vault.

12-interviewer
So is there like, a basic version that you can then progress into the things like the double Kong and all the other variations? There's like, yeah, just like a basic Kong, that people start out learning?

12-participant
Yeah, just just a basic, regular kong, is what, you know, if we were teaching that in my gym, we would just start out with basic simple Kongs. And if anybody wanted to try more advanced type, like a double Kong, kash vaults, something like that, we would set up a longer obstacle, or two obstacles for them to experiment and try it out on while keeping the other simple, you know, Kong vault obstacle up for everybody to just practise on.

12-interviewer
Mm. Are there ways to kind of break down the basic one for those that perhaps aren't learning it straightaway, is there ways to make it easier or build up to it?

12-participant
Yeah, there. There is progressions and techniques, you can use, probably one of the most helpful progressions would be just practising it with no obstacle at all just on the ground, pointing your hands on the floor and bringing your knees through them. And then slowly, just getting used to your knees, going through your arms like that, remembering technique, which would be keeping your hips up, in order to bring your legs through, and everything you're going to need for that you're going to need speed to carry yourself completely through. I see a lot of a lot of people don't have enough speed, so they just get stuck right over the obstacle.

12-interviewer
So with with speed, is it kind of learning to, I think it's, I think you might have said some of this earlier, but like learning to kind of commit to, to going into it with some some power, I guess.

12-participant
Yeah, yeah, you're definitely gonna need at least some element of power to complete it. Because no matter how, you know, short the obstacle is, you are still going to want to be able to carry yourself over it. And that means keeping your feet up and moving at a faster rate.

12-interviewer
I'm curious as well, with the with the floor exercise that you mentioned, what is it that people are getting used to? Is it is it like they trying to get more flexible to get their knees up to the chest? Or are they trying to push off with the hands?

12-participant
Yeah, I would say I guess you can call it a stretch, but mostly it's just getting used to having your knees up to your chest. And so if I would, if somebody wanted to learn a Kong vault, I would tell them practice that floor exercise, as well as other ones such as donkey kicks, which is where you place your hands flat on the floor and you sort of kick your feet up and then back down into a crouch position with your knees to your chest, and just uh, practice. There's a tonne of different names for this but I call them monkey ups or Kong ups you could call them, where you you almost go into a Kong vault, but you don't carry yourself through, you place your hands on top of the obstacle and bring your knees knees up to your chest, just so that your feet get on top of you.

12-interviewer
So just kind of getting used to replacing the hands with the feet almost. Yeah. Well, are there any like particular, sticking points that you've, you kind of see people commonly get stuck with?

12-participant
Commitment is always a big issue a lot of people one, run right up to it, place their hands down and then just stop. Especially on double kongs,  if it's hard to tell if you can't make the distance or if you think you might not be able to. And a lot of people when they go into a kong, they don't get their feet up enough, which requires just your hips to kind of go high up. But if your hips are too low, then your feet are gonna clip the edge, and you're just gonna take a spill.

12-interviewer
So when you kind of moved into coaching, from just practising for yourself, did you, erm, you know, all the kind of talking about Kongs that we've been doing, is that just you've developed that yourself? Or is that been in conversation with other coaches as well? Or with other practitioners? How does how does your kind of knowledge of the movement develop?

12-participant
Um, I would say it mostly developed when I first started classes, and then it came back around more into a conversation topic when I started coaching and had to teach it again. I would watch people who were learning I'd watch them go through the vault, and then break it down with the other people who wanted to learn. And there are a tonne of places that you can find breakdowns of this vault. Before I started going to classes, when I was just kind of jumping around my backyard, I would watch Tapp Brothers on YouTube. And they would do multiple breakdowns, many different vaults and Kong vault was one of them.

12-interviewer
So do you find now when you're coaching that you kind of take that stuff and pass it along to your students? Or is it changed or developed over the years?

12-participant
Some of it changes. It's not that I like disagree, per se, with any anybody that would, you know, break it down, I would just teach it differently, especially depending on who I'm dealing with. Because not everybody's gonna have the same problems, not everybody's gonna have the same mentality. So.

12-interviewer
So you kind of adapt it to the student that you have. And, but it's still kind of your, I guess, you know, as you're part of, you know, group of coaches, do you guys talk about this and share this stuff with each other as well?

12-participant
Not typically, unless it's a variation, more complicated variation, like a Kong gainer. We're gonna break it down to help each other learn a bit more. But since we're all coaches, and we all pretty much know that move, we don't really talk about it too much.

12-interviewer
I guess I mean, in terms of coaching it to other people, do you talk about it as coaches and say, this is how I like to coach it, or?

12-participant
Ah. Yeah, yeah, sometimes, every so often you get like a difference of what needs to be fixed between two coaches, and one student. So say, for instance, me and one of my co workers would be working with a student on their Kong vault. And, you know, I could say, Oh, you need to go back to your progressions, you need to learn about how to get your speed or get your hips up. And then my coworker could say, No, you just need more speed, you know, sometimes it just differs on what we're seeing how we're seeing it. But generally, we're all going to have the same progression progressions to give out and exercises to build strength, just stuff like that were pretty much the same things.

12-interviewer
Is that because those other coaches may have learned from the same places as you, or is it just because that's kind of naturally evolved as like this is a good way to teach it?

12-participant
I would say just because that's the natural way of teaching it you know, there's there's only so many things you can do wrong with the Kong vault. And every every person that I've worked with, has given very similar advice.

12-interviewer
Do you think it's just kind of, er, I don't know, common sense prevails? And people just kind of get these ideas of this is this is working and pass it along?

12-participant
Yeah. Mostly it can be just considered common sense. It could. It could be as simple as just visually, you know, seeing what's wrong with how the person is doing the vault and then telling them what needs to change with it. Or, you know, if they realise what they need to change, but they still can't physically change it. Taking them back to progressions is pretty much what every coach will do.

12-interviewer
Does that kind of ability to assess come from, like, just experience and practice, or...

12-participant
I don't think so, I've talked to a lot of people who say they they have a struggle with seeing what somebody is doing, and then being able to translate what they're doing or what they need to fix. A lot of a, lot of people I train with, say they couldn't be a coach, because they don't know how to translate the movement into a lesson.

12-interviewer
So is that is that like an extra skill that coaches have? That has developed somehow?

12-participant
Yeah, usually, coaches are going to have some extra. Yeah, I guess you'd call it extra skill that helps them teach, tell students what they need to do to fix a certain, like the ability to assess, break down and analyse what a student's doing, how they're doing it wrong, or if they're doing it right.

12-interviewer
Are there any common things with the Kong vault that you might look at to do that assessment, anything you like, Yeah, that that was a really good one. Or vice versa. That was a really bad one.

12-participant
Yeah, I'm always gonna watch the arms, the hips and the knees, or I guess just the legs, because typically, if somebody is doing a kong wrong, it's like, if they're clearing the obstacle, but they're still doing it wrong, it's looking kind of too stiff, too rigid, it's usually going to be either what they're doing during the vault, which has something to do with their arm placement, hip height, or knees coming through, or it has to do with their takeoff. So if I was teaching a student and their kong, was choppy, you know, they would kind of punch into it too hard, and land too hard, let's say their hips are going too high, because their punch was too hard. So they were going in the air too high, taking too much impact on their arms. And then when they land, they're, you know, kind of pushing themselves forward too much. And landing kind of in that position where they're not, you know, they don't have enough momentum, I would say, carry more speed into it. Don't punch so hard. So you don't go as high you want to go over the obstacle like this, not like this.

12-interviewer
So it just because I'm going to transcribe it, just to put it in words, kind of like a fairly shallow arc over the obstacle, you don't want to go up too up and then down on the other side?

12-participant
Exactly, because the more more high of an arc that you have, the more impact you're taking, which is stopping you from moving forward, but but the more shallow the arc is, the more you're going to be able to continue your momentum.

12-interviewer
So kind of minimising the amount of up and down that you have to do, letd you keep that horizontal speed, I guess. And I like that you said, used the word choppy as well. So kind of if it's very stop-start, is that you mean, like you want like a smooth?

12-participant
Yeah, sort of flowy movement.

12-interviewer
And are there, like, are there certain ways that you might spot the movement for people when you're teaching it to them or do you just let them go for it?

12-participant
I would usually after progressions, if they look confident with it, and if they're telling me they're comfortable enough to try it. I would say go ahead and just go for it. I don't really know any ways to spot a kong vault besides just I guess, putting a mat down behind the obstacle, so if they have a bad landing, you know, they'll be caught. But, yeah, I would just say, if you feel like you can do it, just go for it, exercise caution, as always.

12-interviewer
Yeah, to kind of make sure that you, you've maybe satisfied yourself that they are ready for that. But at some point, you just have to let them try it. In a way, yeah. Cool. Are there any kind of like coaching cues that you might give? Anything that come like, comes up often?

12-participant
Any coaching, what?

12-interviewer
Coaching cues, like common things that you might say to someone, like, keep your chest up or something.

12-participant
For Kong vault, specifically?

12-interviewer
Mm.

12-participant
Hips are the most important. And I think that's really hard for a lot of people to understand. Because you don't really think about your hips through movement and your focus on your arms, what you see right in front of you, you're not going to focus on but your hips have to come up in order to get your knees through. So you don't clip your feet. And yeah, like, like I said before, also keeping your chest down. So you're not you're not coming up too hard on the ending and sort of choking the landing, you want to keep your chest down, hips up, to carry through.

12-interviewer
With the with the hips up thing, why is it do you think people might struggle with that?

12-participant
Because, well, feet clipping is one of the most common mistakes when you're doing a Kong vault, it's usually going to happen when you start trying it. And I think it's a common mistake. Because when, like I said before, when you're going over the obstacle, you're focused on what you see in front of you, not what you see behind you, so you focus on the hands, you're focused on the obstacle, you're not really thinking about your legs or your hips, because you don't even see them per se, so you have to, in that moment, listen to your body, more than your mind. And I wouldn't say that for most of [unclear]

12-interviewer
And what kind of thing would you would you do to kind of help someone with that hip, hip raise, if they were struggling?

12-participant
Um, I would give them different progressions to do, I think most coaches would do that, sort of go back to the drawing board, I'd even what helps a lot of times, especially with myself, I found is that taking a video of the mistake, and showing it to that person, they'll see what they're doing wrong. And in their mind, they'll be like, Okay, so that's what I have to do, because sometimes describing it only gets you so far. And they might not even know what you mean, until they actually see it themselves.

12-interviewer
It's very, um, very visual. Yeah, I can see that they can assess themselves almost a little bit.

12-participant
Yeah.

12-interviewer
Mm. So we've actually covered a lot of the questions that I like to try and ask people, which is great. It's been very quick, very, to the point, which is great. Some people say a lot for some of these questions. I'm curious, really just for yourself. So there, is there anything about the movement that you you know, would like to know more about? Or is it you're curious about for the movement?

12-participant
What I would really like to do at some point and this is part of the main reason that I'm going to college for exercise science is that I would love to be able to put on one of those like little suits with the dots on it and have cameras record me going through the movement of a Kong vault to see specifically maybe how it's different from other people's, take a closer in depth look a bit maybe see what muscles are specifically contracting. And let's say if I you know, had a problem with my Kong vault, I could see specifically what muscles needed to be improved in order to get stronger, cos there would be no way of knowing completely what specific muscles to improve. Let's say I was in, I wanted to do a double Kong, but I wasn't pushing hard enough with my arms or absorbing the landing correctly with my arms on the second kong that I would say just off the top of my head, I would say, triceps would be a huge part of that. But let's say I didn't know that, a video recording of that in depth, while wearing that suit would show me the impact taken on the second kong. And it would show me that all this impact can't be absorbed. But building those muscles, and getting used to that movement would allow me to absorb it better. So push ups, handstand push ups, things like that wouldn't help build those specific muscles.

12-interviewer
I can't remember if we actually discussed it. But is strength important to the Kong vault then? Or is it more technique?

12-participant
For a simple Kong vault, I would say it's all technique. But a lot of variations take a lot more strength. Even even just a dive Kong is gonna require a little bit more leg strength for the speed to run up to it. And launching yourself. It's just gonna take a little bit more muscle strength.

12-interviewer
And do you have, um, yeah, you mentioned putting on the suit, the suit with the dots on it and stuff? Do you have any kind of theories you'd like to test out? You know, beyond muscle strength? Is there anything about it that you're like, really curious about? Because I'll be honest, it's the kind of thing that I want to do as well. So I'm really curious what people that are interested in, in the movement. You know, you mentioned strength, is there anything else about the movement, you're curious about?

12-participant
I would say for this movement, not particularly, I'm pretty confident in my form and technique for it. But in a lot of other movements, I'd love to break down, you know, especially certain flips, I'd love to see how specifically the body knows when to open up, when to land, especially on these blind landings. Like, like front flips, the body just sort of opens up at the right moment, after a lot of experience with that flip. You just, it's just body instinct and spatial awareness. You know, what you're doing on vaults to you know, a person who's been doing Kong vaults for a long time, won't even look at the obstacle. They're just their eyes are straight ahead. And they're just right over it. So it sort of begs the question, how do they know? What's there? By not even looking at spatial awareness, experience and instinct?

12-interviewer
Yeah, it just kind of, I guess, does that that kind of level of confidence come from just experience and repetition? Do you think?

Yeah, for sure, I'd say so my gym likes to talk about how you haven't truly mastered a flip unless you've done it 1000 times. And I think that applies to vaults as well, because you can do a Kong vault once. And you know, your first Kong vault can be very messy and, and you can't really say oh, you know, I completely mastered it. No [unclear] I don't think there is a specific point, though, when you master a vaults, or a flip, I think, just one day, you're going to realise I'm so comfortable with this, I've mastered it.

Yeah, its, um. Yeah, I find that confidence is really a big part of it. Because he there is that commitment of diving onto something. Yeah. Do you think then for the like, really, really advanced practitioners... Like, there's just more, they're just more committed to the movement? And that's why they can do these incredible things, or is it technique improvement?

12-participant
I would say it's, it's a wide combination of a lot of things. So people who are very comfortable with Kongs, have done it a lot of times so they're used to the movement, and they've probably done a lot of more difficult things, more difficult variations. And that really helps a lot with confidence. You know, if you can do a double kong, you can certainly do a single kong. So in that instance, you're not going to be too worried about doing a similar kong, cos [unclear] confidence, I think wouldn't be problem for that specific vault, if you're more experienced and you can do more difficult things.

12-interviewer
Is there, is there anything else that's kind of popped into your head or you thought at any point, while we've been talking that we didn't get chance to get to? Or that you'd like to, to add?

12-participant
Um, no, I think so.

12-interviewer
I just remembered one other question. I'm sorry. So, as a as a coach as well, now, do you, um, you know, we've talked about how you've kind of developed the movement and then slightly changed things for coaching and maybe talk to other coaches about it and stuff. Do you think that it's something that would be useful for coaches to have to have like something to refer to to, to talk about, this is a good way to coach the Kong? Or do you think it's good that people just have their own personal experiences that inform how they coach or...

12-participant
I think personal experiences are very important, especially because they can give you a different look on what a student might need. So if everything was, if I say this, if the way to teach a Kong vault was completely, you know, the same completely flat for every single student, I think a lot of students would not be able to do it, because students need to learn differently. So they, they might need a different environment to learn it in, they might need different obstacles to learn it from, they might even just need different progressions. So your own personal personal experiences influencing the way you coach are very important. Because if you meet a student that needs to learn the same way you learned or needs to practice the same way you practice, you can then use that for them. But if you learned one way, in one way only, and they need to learn a different way. It would be nice to have another coach with the same experiences and personal experience that they need to learn.

12-interviewer
I'm curious, what about if you had a student who doesn't respond to the way that you learnt it, and maybe there wasn't another coach, that you know, if it was if you're the only coach in the area. You know, how would you kind of, I guess, as a coach, get those other experiences or get that wider knowledge base to coach more people who aren't necessarily all learning it the same way you are.

12-participant
I would, I would try to see the obstacle and see the vault from the students point of view, I tried to, literally try to do the vault with the exact same mistakes they're making, to feel how it feels to do what they're doing. And when I know how to correctly do that vault. I can say, Okay, here's the difference. I know what it feels like. So maybe I wouldn't even be able to see what they're doing wrong. But if I try and do it the way they're doing it, I can feel it and then I can tell them how to change it.

12-interviewer
Mm. Cool. Um, yeah, I know I already asked this but just in case anything came up in that last question. Is there anything anything more you'd like to to add? Or that you sort of you, might throw in?

12-participant
Uhh.... [shakes head]

12-interviewer
Cool. In that case then yeah, we've we've kind of gone through, gone through pretty quick. Hit all the all the kind of areas I like to try and get to with people. So yeah, if there's nothing else I'll stop the recording. Yeah. Cool.
