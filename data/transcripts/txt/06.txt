Alright, there we go. Alright. So I guess the place I've been kind of starting these with people is just to little to explain a little bit about the study and the goals. There's a little bit about it in the information sheet. But just to say that I'm kind of trying to talk to people parkour coaches in particular about how they understand the parkour techniques that have kind of evolved over time. Because it's kind of a decentralised sport. It doesn't have like a central rulebook or guideline or governing body or anything at the moment. It's just kind of grown organically. So I'm interested how people kind of understand these organically developed movements, right. And I pick the Kong vault just as kind of like, a well known movement to start with. So I guess the first thing to kind of check with you is like, is, is the term Kong vault, one that you recognise is that the word the the term that you use? Do you know it as something else?

06-participant
Yeah, Kong vault or catpass, interchangeably? And then there's some people call it stuff like the King Kong vault, but that's, nah. Kong or catpass.

06-interviewer
Okay. Is there is the one or the other, do you tend to find yourself using? Or does it not really matter?

06-participant
It doesn't really matter? It depends on who I'm with because different people have different phrases, and I'm just sort of whatever helps the most people and we both understand. When I'm coaching, I use Kong. That's probably most important to the study. I use kong for that.

06-interviewer
Okay. And you might not know, do you know, perhaps where you maybe first heard that term?

06-participant
Yeah, YouTube. The Tapp Brothers and Ronnie Street Stunts [laughs] Classics.

06-interviewer
And I guess, how would you just how would you describe the movement? If you're going to put it into words?

06-participant
Yeah, so it's, you're trying to get over a wall quickly, to very simply , you run up up to a wall, put your hands on the wall, sort of push yourself over, and bring your feet through your hands, so that you land on the other side?

06-interviewer
Okay, so is it just to try and get like some more detail for that? Is it two hands at the same time? Is it one hand then the other? Like...

06-participant
Yeah okay, I'll break it down like fully then, see you come into it, and you've got two techniques for takeoff, you've either got just the split foot, which is the most common, so like a one to almost like a into like a gallop, or a hurdle, that's going to propel you off the ground. Or, there's the word that I can't remember. But it's basically a two footed jump. So you're almost like diving into it. Um, just before, then, you've got the dip as well. So you want to have your eyes, like, level with the wall and two foot takeoff, plant both hands at the same time. And they're going to be pretty much in line with your eyes, you're then going to use this sort of push, to push yourself up. And as your feet sort of get, as your toes are about to touch the edge of the wall, you push off of your hands to sort of like Naruto run through the air,  bring your feet like through that gap that was created by your hands. And then as you come off, you're still you push and you bring your chest up, your feet come down and you basically land in like a rolling position.

06-interviewer
Okay. Is is that, like a description that you just kind of thought up just now? Or is that something that you, you, kind of would have ready to go for a class or something, is it...

06-participant
There's a couple like key elements in there that I use a lot when I'm teaching. It's quite odd doing this over Zoom, because like I feel when I'm coaching it's so important to show. And especially like for parkour, and as someone who's always learned through like seeing and then trying, it's much easier but yeah, so I'd like the key bits, I'm always like, you got to start with a dip, because if you're above the wall, you're going to find it so hard to pop your feet through. And so dip is the first step. The takeoff is the second step. It's not too important in like the early stages, so long as like they're getting over the wall I'm not fussed whether it's a two foot takeoff or split foot takeoff, that's fine. Um, planting in the hands. And that weird sort of like pull-push movement is very important. And yeah, getting their feet up to the wall. If I was like teaching that I break it down so like, let's start with a dip or get 'em used to just pushing up and not even like taking their feet off the ground. Then from like a standing position, and get 'em used to just pushing up and jumping to like getting their feet on the wall, and depending on the width of the wall, trying to get them more and more forwards, if they're struggling with that, you can do it on the floor as well. So I'll put like a line on the floor, and I'll say right, put your hands here. You know, you're almost in like a crawl position, put your hands here and pull through, and you want to try and get your feet over this line. And then you take it back to the wall. And then yeah, from the wall, just getting used to just dropping off. And then let's slowly put it together. So dip, jump up onto the wall, move your feet. Keep doing that until your feet further and further forward until they just, clear.

06-interviewer
That's a great description. I agree. It's, it's kind of weird. Because it it's usually a very visual thing.

06-participant
Yeah.

06-interviewer
What, what's, what's important about the dip, part? What does that contribute?

06-participant
I think it's so important to lower like, your chest is where a lot of the movement comes from. It's the dip, powering upwards of that. And I don't know too much about centres of gravity. But I imagine that's going to do a bit. But the point is, it's by lowering yourself almost like a spring, you can then go back up, its the same reason like it's you get a better jump, if you bend your legs, and then jump up rather than just jumping from standing. So yeah you get that dip. And then it's sort of easier to hurl yourself over the wall, almost in an arc, you're down to come up.

06-interviewer
And you mentioned as well, the two main types of takeoff. With the split foot one, I think you said being more common.

06-participant
Yeah.

06-interviewer
Does it make a difference which one you use?

06-participant
At the start, like when I'm teaching, I tend to just like I said, Get the feet over the wall. And what you tend to see or I tend to see with like beginners, including myself, is that the punch technique, which is the two foot, just punching two feet into the ground and going, is easier because people are more familiar with it, they don't have to think about, oh, I'm going left foot right foot, takeoff. But as you develop, and if you want to like continue your practice, and especially if you want to focus on things like, like flowing into it, not just having it as one isolated moment, if you want to be able to run into it, I find a split foot's really, really useful. And it's why a lot of like advanced practitioners use that because it's more flexible, especially if you can do both sides. So if you can only do left foot right foot, takeoff, if you ever run into it, and you've only got enough space for two steps into the wall, and that's going to be right foot left, what you're going to have to hop which is going to look really weird. Or you're going to have to punch, which is not as smooth, or you just have to give up and start again [unclear] I think it's a matter of preference. I think in the wider community like the split foot is looked upon more favourably, just because of the benefits it offers in terms of like flow, and like connecting it together. And you know, not having to stop that punch in the name of efficiency. With a, when I'm coaching especially when I'm coaching kids, and especially when they've not done it before. I'm not fussed, they get over the wall, and I'll teach them the split foot later, I learned with the punch in and learnt the split foot so. Think it's fine. It doesn't make too much difference.

06-interviewer
And so when you're, when you're actually coming to the obstacle itself, I mean, it's obviously difficult to say because these things are very, it could be a huge number of reasons you might use it but are there like particular types of obstacles its more commonly used on or situations it's more commonly used in?

06-participant
Yeah. In terms of surfaces, walls rather than handrails, just because it feels more comfortable to have your hands flat on the wall rather than gripping rounds and thin and then sort of pulling yourself. And so generally walls [unclear] outs and rather than just being like... it often goes into like a pre or like you're trying to take off somewhere and land on another surface that isn't just the ground, like a raised surface. Um... yeah, and obviously there's variations like double Kongs, dive kongs, Kong gainers, all this jazz, kong fronts as well but in it's like simplest its just doing a kong. I think rather than just... it's either to get a bunch of power to go really fast and just throw yourself over it. Or it's to sort of have a controlled takeoff where your feet are going very forward so you can land very nicely in a pre.

06-interviewer
So is that, is there something about the movement that you think on the other side lends itself to, to doing a precision, is it? 

06-participant
Yeah-

06-interviewer
Maybe compared to some other vaults or?

06-participant
Yeah, I think they obviously a lot of vaults can lead to pres. But I think the kong is the most favoured one, at least I found because it generates a lot of power. So you can get a good amount of distance, you're not going to, I mean, obviously, it depends wall to wall, but like, I don't know, honestly, standard, that's not a thing. There's no such thing as a standard kong pre. Um... [overlap] It generates a lot of power.

06-interviewer
[overlap] I know what you mean, it's difficult, which is one of the reasons I'm trying to talk to people is like, there, there isn't really like, "the" Kong vault. There's a lot of things. But just talking in terms of like, common things or, or typical cases, I guess.

06-participant
I think unlike vaults, perhaps like the lazy vault or the step vault, it's easier to change how much power you're generating. So it's very easy to kong and go over the wall and almost land with your heels on the side of that wall. And it's not a technique that's used very often, but it's, you know, you can stand and just launch yourself over. Um, but you could also generate a lot of distance and a lot of height. And it's you know, and you can change that depending on how much you dip, how much you pull, how much you like punch, how much speed you go into it with. So in terms of like how different every environment is, it's very flexible. In terms of what the actual, like precision movement, you come into it and your eyes, as soon as they go over that wall, you're going to spot what you're going to land on, your feet are then going to come through and they're going to be extended like so they're going to be here, you're heads here. And they're going to come through, they're going to be extended in front of you. And for me, um, that's how you want to do a pre, you want to see your feet extended out in front of you, your legs extended out in front of you like this, so that you know ah yeah, my toes are gonna go there, I'm gonna land perfectly. And that bringing the legs through from behind, and coming through and like pushing forwards sets yourself perfectly up to just go [gestures] and get that really nice stick.

06-interviewer
Do the, so you've mentioned the kind of push-pull on the wall, or the obstacle, do the arms like contribute a lot to the movement or are they just like, touching?

06-participant
Yeah, no, definitely. So again, like how much force you put into that movement where you put your hands in the wall and like you sort of... when you're doing the dip, you're almost pulling yourself forward, but as soon as you clear that wall to push, is the Naruto arms, the only way I've ever found to describe that. But it works. And yeah, the hands. Yeah. Yeah, you're generating a huge amount of power, how far you can get forward. It's like based on that like, push away like movement. Um... And yeah, it separates it from just like hurdling. You're dipping and you're generating that power to go upwards. And I don't know, it'll be weird to do without hands. It would just be like a box jump.

06-interviewer
Yes. Do you, um, do you consider it like a fundamental movement for people to learn when they're learning parkour, is it an important part...

06-participant
100%. Yeah, yeah. 100%. Because like I say it leads on to so many other options. So you've got your standard Kong over the wall. You can do kong pres. You can go on to dive Kongs, which then develop into double Kongs, um, if you want to do some like tricking flipping stuff, you got Kong gainers, kong fronts. And, and then just as a move for like climbing as well like if you want to quickly get on top of something that doesn't require necessarily a whole like climb up, but it doesn't require full extension like if it's about probably about like chest height. Like you can pretty much just jump on and like pop with the Kong motion onto the wall. And even if it's a little bit higher that you can put your foot on as if you're doing a wall run. And rather than end up in cat hang into climb up, you can just pop straight up. I think it's there's not really like a general name for it but I have always just known it as like the pop up, or the top out or the pop vault, yeah. And, and that's all at the foundation of that is in the kong. Like I was saying about doing it on the floor as well, like quadrupedal movement. You start with the Kong. Like you can do, one of my friends calls them ape crawls, where just like jump forward and like pounce you know two hands, two feet, two hands, two feet. And, and even like, I don't know why like I think people are preferring it aesthetically over like rolls at the minute is that you don't land and go into a roll-

06-interviewer
For landing?

06-participant
Yeah, so you land and almost like shuffle like you do a kong to the side. [unclear] And then like pull up. Again, I don't know exactly why that is, but I think it's mostly an aesthetic thing. And mostly I think it feels quicker. Like you hit the floor, you tap and you're straight up. But yeah, the Kongs like sort of a fundamental movement. I think if you look back to the sort of animals that parkour has always been inspired by look at monkeys and cats and lemurs. It's all about being on all fours. That's all about that. Like pouncing motion. Like cat motion on King Kong monkey style motion. So yeah, having it's a foundation of any, any movement. Yeah.

06-interviewer
Is it something that you think is pretty unique to parkour as well? In terms of sport, maybe?

06-participant
Yeah. Yeah, I think so. I have the, I spoke briefly about hurdles before. They're very deliberately not using the hands. I guess obstacle course race, racing, you could use it, but it's not really a, it's not an obstacle course technique. It's a parkour technique. And I know there's things like [name] at the minute which claims it's nothing to do with parkour but is definitely to do with parkour. They use like, Kong motions and claim you know, is it's it's an animalistic, primal movement. So even when this movement does sort of, like permeate into other parts of sports, like movement practices, its foundations is in parkour. Yeah.

06-interviewer
Is it quite a, like, iconic parkour movement as well? Is it like

06-participant
100%.

06-interviewer
Yeah.

06-participant
100%. Yeah. I mean, as soon as you say kong, like, I can't help but think of Imax in London, because, you know, it's just crazy, like Kongs everywhere. Yeah, I'd say it's like the, the parkour movement if someone were like oh what's the movement that you feel most defines parkour, I'd be like, the Kong vault because it's efficient. It does what it needs to do. It requires like a level of agility, and like, mental focus as well. And, and it leads to so many other things. Like, like, I've listed them off before, so I won't do it again. It's such a fundamental movement. Yeah, I'd say it's the, "the" parkour movement. If I had to pick one, that would be the one.

06-interviewer
I'm curious. You said about the mental side of it as well. What is it, what's mental about the Kong vault?

06-participant
Getting the feet through the hands, especially the first few times like, I mean, I've been doing parkour six and a half years, so it's fine now. I don't really get scared about it, sometimes on a rail. Just because I'm worried I'm not getting the height. Yeah, the biggest fear that I found when I was younger, and I find in like students now is that they're going to jump up, they're going to try and clear the wall. They're going to clip their toes or their shins, and they're just gonna faceplant into the floor. And I've seen kids do that and they're fine. They always get open, just go, oh pkay. You know, but that fear of just going headfirst because of something that you can't see. I think that's a big part of it as well. Like, you're just trusting that your feet are going to come over. And yeah, there's a certain amount of like, prep you can do, like I went through earlier. But yeah, it's that sort of one of like, at least when I was practising that was the first move I ever learned. And that was the first mental barrier I had to get over was, I'm just gonna have to trust that hte technique that I've got is good enough to get my feet over this wall. If it's not I'm gonna faceplant. We'll get there when we get there. See what happens [laugh]

06-interviewer
Can you remember, erm, like about your experience learning out? Was it easy or hard?

06-participant
Yeah, I have a video of it. That's the oldest parkour video I have is of me doing that, learning that move. And yeah, it was fine. It took me like, if between like 40 and 50 minutes, I was just on this like fallen like tree, this huge, like fallen tree near my house. And I had watched a bunch of the tutorials I talked about before, so Tapp Brother, Robbie [unclear], because there wasn't like coaching provision where I lived. And I was like, Oh, you know, actually, I'm just gonna try this. And I sort of like, I almost like, accidentally did the steps I was breaking down before, like, I didn't start the dip because I didn't know that was a thing. But I just practice, like trying to just jump up onto the wall. And it took me ages to even stay on the wall. Like I was jumping up my feet were hitting and I was just bouncing straight off. And then from there, it got to like, okay, I can get my feet on the wall. How far can I get them? How far can I get them? And you can see in the video, like, if you imagine the curve of the trunk, I was hitting the side, hitting the side, sitting the side then I was hitting the top, then I was going over, then I was going over, and then I just cleared and you can do here in the video me just going [breaths in]. And just like absolutely, like yeah! But yeah, I mean, it's, it took a long time. And I think, had I had coaches, had I been coached, then the movement would have taken a lot less time. Because I wouldn't have been correcting my own technique. Someone else would have said, Oh, just dip a little bit more here. I'd be like, nice.

06-interviewer
I'm curious, then if you were, if you were kind of self taught, when you started to connect up with other people doing parkour, or particularly when you moved into maybe coaching with actual coaching groups, I think I think you were coaching with a group, right?

06-participant
Yeah, [name]. I was officially coaching with them for half a year, but I coached for like, a year before that just sort of, I'd turn up and just help so yeah, well, yeah.

06-interviewer
Yeah, whether whether you, when you started to kind of make those connections, did your kind of self developed technique, did you kind of learn new things when you, or did you find that the thing you self taught yourself matched up with what the other people were doing? Or...?

06-participant
Yeah, so like, it wasn't wrong, I didn't have to relearn anything. There were like tweaks and improvements to be made, again, mainly the dip, just because I didn't know that was a thing. But it changed it completely. And I mean, it was it was a good like, five years between meetings, like learning that and then starting coaching. So like I was training with, like lots of people before. I dunno like, yeah, I didn't feel it was wrong, didn't have to relearn anything, what I learned just training with people and like, I guess in terms of challenges, like when I was just doing a kong on my own, it was just a kong vault over and over and over again. And there was no variation of that maybe I do it left to right. And I do it right to left over the same obstacle. And then when I met other people, like I saw, there's more opportunity with this. And then when I started trying those challenges and found them difficult, then I would get almost like peer to peer feedback. And you know, someone I trained with would go, Oh, you just need to try lifting your chest a bit higher, or, you know, throw your arms back a bit further. And these little things that made me see that, oh, yeah, it's not just this isolated movement, there are loads of different things I can adjust to change the outcome. And yeah, I mean, the development came much quicker with other people than just on my own.

06-interviewer
And now, like as a coach, are you finding that students are like, have some of the same things that you found you could improve or learn from other people? Would you find that there's common things that come up in terms of challenges for students with the movement?

06-participant
Yeah, so I find that most students come in without knowing what it is and they've not seen they've maybe seen a video of parkour but they can't quite point at it and go that's a Kong vault and they've often not tried it before. And the most common thing is, they sort of run up to it. Punch off and then I don't know it's almost like an instant, No, I'm not gonna put my feet through there and they do like a two handed speed vault when I don't know like, you even if, I've got a bunch of younger siblings, and like when they were younger, like seeing them play in the park and stuff, like, that's how kids just get over things, they put two hands, like as a support point, they throw the rest of their body over and push off. So kids they automatically go into that. So either challenge for kids that haven't done parkour before., for like coaching them it, is going, stop doing that, just put your hand over here. And then it goes into the breakdown again, okay, you're scared to put your feet over the wall. Let's practice just trying to get them up onto the wall. Um but yeah the most challenging thing is I think that kids just come in with the knowledge of being kids playing in the playground. And that's great. Because, you know, I mean, you can watch kids play, and you can see parkour without it having a name, like they're just being kids. They're just playing around. And it's great. And we're it's sort of being like, what you doing is great. But it's not what this is... Yeah, yeah. I keep going on about the dip, because I think it's the most like, it's the thing that's missed the most and the thing that people struggle with the most because they they think I'm trying to go over this wall. Why would I lower myself if I actually want to go up, you know, but that's where the problems come in. If you just jump from straight, you might clip your feet, you're probably not going to clear it unless you've got like the technique nailed. And so again, and to do a movement that perhaps is unfamiliar, like you don't see people walking around, like bent over at 90 degrees. Because that would be weird. We're used to being up where [unclear], so getting people to like crouch down, put their hands on the wall to go up. It's just, it can take a while to get into people's heads. Just because it's not a movement pattern that we're really familiar with. Yeah.

06-interviewer
Are there... So what what kind of thing would you be looking for in order to say like, yeah, that's a good, that's a good Kong, or maybe you need to work on this, like a, when you're coaching in particular, are there things you're looking out for, in order to be able to say, yeah, this that was good, or we should work on this, or?

06-participant
Yeah, so in terms of the takeoff, how far they are from the wall can make a huge difference, if you're too far, you're going to be stretching, and you're not going to get over just gonna sort of crash your hips into the wall. Maybe too close, you're not going to get your feet over. So you're just gonna again probably crash your hips into the wall, say, oh, why don't you try doing that a little bit closer, or a little bit further back. Don't want to go on about the dip anymore, bt the dip, you know, maybe dip a bit lower, or maybe they're dipping too low, like you shouldn't be like touching your nose before, you know sort of thing. Um, the push from the arms, I tend to find is one. And they just sort of put their hands in a wall a bit like you're asking about before, and then not supporting their kids just want to jump and I'm like you've got hands, push your weight through them. And again, that's why I do the exercise of push yourself up and pop your feet onto the wall. And then yeah, yeah, just like coming out of it as well, again, I think related to that sideways movement, a lot of kids they do it, they get their feet through, then they take one arm off. And they sort of end up with this sort of like half spin out of it. And I'm like, just keep that hand on a second longer and push off at the same time. which is again, why I practice, get on the wall, practice pushing off and jumping down. And yeah, I think those are like the main things because when you correct them the rest of it sort of just comes, like, naturally.

06-interviewer
And how about in terms of like connecting the vault to other movements or other things? Is it, is it an easy vault to like drop into a route or is it...

06-participant
Um, for kids, yeah, because like, especially like that first like, couple years of like learning. Like first year perhaps of learning, everything's very punchy. They're very like, they're all in what they're running around in a circle and there might be like a series of obstacles. Well, it's not a constant flow like a wave, stop, punch, over stop, punch over. Um.  I think again, I find that the if you try and get them to do it quicker if you're trying to do it too fast. How am I wording this. If you try and get them to do the movement too fast... This is, this is just I think I'm tripping over myself. Get them to move too quickly, in too short amount of time, they'll go back to just that fear of, I'm going too fast and I'm going to clip my feet. Let's just go to the side, or let's just run into the wall and try again. Yeah, I feel for flow instead of like a punchy, punchy term, it's really easy, because unlike the lazy vault, where they have to stop and think about, okay, I have to put my hand down and swing my legs or when I put my hand down, and then land. It's very simple. You start here you go, you finish it. And that's the move complete. And yeah, I got stuck [unclear]

06-interviewer
That's all good. So that that little description you gave there about like you, you start here, you go over you stop here. Is that like, I think we might have talked about it. Is that like a typical kind of Kong? Because I think as well, you mentioned, there's like, a whole bunch of variations, like, double Kongs and stuff. Are they their own movement? Or are they extensions of the same movement? It's a bit of a metaphysical question, maybe but I'm curious how people think about these things.

06-participant
I'd say they're extensions of the same movement. So if if my ultimate goal is to teach someone, the double kong, I teach them the Kong first, so they've got that down, then I'll teach them the dive Kong. And I feel a double Kong is a mix of the two. So the double Kong, obviously, you're doing two, two Kong movements, there are two walls, you put your hand on both sets of walls, and you try to get your feet to clear them. But I think the first Kong in a double kong is a normal kong. Like you're just going up, you try to get as much height as possible. And then from that, you then go into the dive Kong, you get that hip pop, which is very unique to the dive kong. And, and again, if I'm teaching that the elements from the very like foundation, of the kong comes in, I guess someone can do a normal Kong, and a dive kong, but is struggling with a double kong, I'll go okay. First of all, you put your hands on, you got to jump up to your feet. And then as quickly as you come from that, you're going to push off your feet and dive out with that. And that gets them used to like being high popping their hips up. Then as it gets quicker and quicker, I'm like, okay, good. Can you do it and try and like, spend as little time on the wall as possible. And they do that. And they do that. And then it just gets to a point where I'm like, okay, all you need to do now is take off that step where your feet are on the wall. And hopefully by that point, they're hardly putting any weight on it. Like the toes are tapping and they're going off. And there is an element of sort of like the actual send it not as in like you don't know what you're doing, just throw yourself at it but you have all of the movements down. There's one thing that you need to push past and the only way you're going to push past that is to do it. But I've never, I've never heard of anyone learning a double Kong without first knowing in at least what a normal Kong is. The dive kong is so important so because that hip pop is incredibly important.

06-interviewer
Is the dive kong, where you're, you're trying to cross like a wider obstacle and so you're diving further before the hands contact?

Yeah, so it's either, it's either diving over a wider obstacle. Because obviously, if you if you if your hands are too short, your feet are going to land on the obstacle, that's not what you want, you want to dive further. But it's also like in terms of like Imax two where there are two walls that you could double Kong, and you're trying to reach the first one. Sometimes, sometimes it's clearing a large obstacle. Sometimes it's jumping over a gap to catch your hands on that wall, and like you could do that, Imax is perhaps a bad example, if there's not an obstacle you have to clear before the second obstacle. So Imax two is actually, you know, is the wall and the second wall. With that, I think the best thing to do is a dive kong because you're gonna have to dive over that headfirst anyway, you're set up for that. But if that wall wasn't there, perhaps an easier option, snd maybe, perhaps an easier options would be to go for like the cat hang or the waist cat. But in terms of efficiency, which is what some people like to define parkour as like, you know, the root cause of your train is to be efficient. Jumping to like a position where you have to stop and then pull up and then pop over is so much slower than just slapping your hands in the wall. So but yeah, like fundamentally it's just for clearing. But for reaching a point on a wall, this, um... that if you were, the dive kong is, you're trying to put your hands where they wouldn't reach if you just were standing still. Like there's a moment in the air where you're feet aren't on the floor. But neither, your hands aren't on the wall and it's that moment of diving like Superman.

06-interviewer
Is that, is that kind of different to a, again, a standard, typical kong? In that you're kind of you're diving almost down onto the thing, rather than-

06-participant
Yeah.

06-interviewer
-Going up to it from that dip. You mentioned.

06-participant
Yeah. So right, yeah. So rather than going up, I think there's still an element of the dip to the dive kong, but, rather than in the normal kong, where you're going down, you're going up and over. And like your hips, they have to pop a little bit so that your feet can get through the gap. We don't have to be way up here, with a dive Kong, you're going up, your hips are going up above your head, I think that's a difference. In the normal Kong, your hips tend to be pretty much in line with your head, but they don't tend to go much higher. Whereas with like the dive kong, you can be at, perhaps an extreme example butyou can be at like 45 degrees, and your head can be the bottom and your feet can be the other end. Yeah, for the dive kong, I think its more, you have to get down low again, but it's not so that you can propel your chest up, it's so that you can pop your hips up. Yeah.

06-interviewer
Okay. We've actually, like you've been very efficient. And we've, we've got through most of the main points that I try and hit with people. I'm just having a... Yeah, it's great. Makes makes my job easier to transcribe it. Is there anything else kind of about the Kong vault that you can think of that maybe we haven't got to or that you think is important that hasn't come up yet?

06-participant
I guess it's the move where like, more than anything, you know, your hands are feet. I had a girl say that to me once I think she went to college. And she was like watching all the videos. And she was like, it's bizarre. Like parkour is so weird because your hands become feet. Well, you know, going back to I was saying before about like monkeys and cats and stuff. It's going, Yeah, I've got four limbs. And they're not two arms and two legs. They're just four limbs. And I think with the Kong, like it's a move... I don't think there are many vaults that are too similar to that. Like even in like the lazy vault, or like the dash vault. Well in the lazy vault the hands are more like a pivot point for your body to come round. And then you just push it off, and it's all about the feet. Whereas with the kong like the hands are so important, and for especially for stuff like the dive kong, like there's a moment where all of your weight is on your hands. Yeah, I don't know if that's the point that I just made or if it's just something I've just said. What... Yeah, I think it's like yeah, it's the one where you, yeah, yeah. Where your arms are used not just as like support points, but as like things that you're actually balancing and moving on, like people do Kongs to handstands and stuff. Which I think is mad because I can't handstand. But yeah, it's almost like an inversion of what we're used to, again, is like bipeds, it's not just moving back to being like a quadruped. It's like being an inverted biped. Especially in dive kongs, because your hands are the first thing on the ground. And that's why for a lot of people, it's so scary because we're not used to that. Yeah, yeah.

06-interviewer
Yeah, I think-

06-participant
I think that's getting into like the very nitty gritty of it, that not some theory I really talk about too much in coaching much. It's like an observation I've made mostly based on that comment, which I'd never thought of before in my life, until this girl said this to me.

06-interviewer
I think it's a really good point. And do you think it means that, um. Maybe that's, you know, I think he said that at the end, though, it's kind of why the movement can be a bit intimidating to people. It's, it's not something that's maybe natural to us. Although people describe it as like an unnatural, even like monkeys and cats and stuff. For us. It's something that we have to learn.

06-participant
Yeah, we're used to being vertical. Whereas I think more than most of our vaults like the Kong vault exists on a horizontal plane, rather than a vertical plane. Like the lazy vault you start up, you swing your legs around, but you pretty much stay up the whole time. Dash vault, you stay up, you just bring your legs over the wall, but your chest is in place. Whereas the kong, that dip puts you on a horizontal plane where you're try to go over, there's a little bit up but it's a [gesture] rather than a [gesture] I know, you can't transcribe that, because I'm moving my hand. Maybe you can do some funky diagrams [laugh]

06-interviewer
Yeah. I think that's actually a really, really great insight. That's a really good way to describe it. Cool. So the thing I've been kind of finishing with with a lot of people is to just ask, Is there anything about the Kong vault, the movement, that you're curious to know more about yourself? You know, the questions you might have about it?

06-participant
I'm sure there's some.... I think, like mostly just is like a curiosity about things I can't do. Like, I don't do any flips. So the idea of like, a kong gainer, some where you're trying to go forwards and then go up, but then you're throwing your feet forwards, up and over to then kick back. Just the mechanics of that baffles me. Like, I just don't understand It. But as for the core, like Kong vault. Don't know, I want I want to find something like really important to see but I can't think of anything [laugh]

06-interviewer
Okay. Just because I noticed I've made a note about it, and I forgot to ask you, I think you used the word efficient for the vault at some point.

06-participant
Yeah.

06-interviewer
Does efficient mean, fast? Or what? What's your kind of use of efficient for it?

06-participant
I think in parkour there's like two stages to efficient. So the primary one is speed, is how fast you can go. But, I think the reason we don't say in terms of speed is because it's a second element, which is important, but perhaps not always seen as important, which is like energy conservation. Like there's a reason that we don't hurdle walls, generally, there's a reason that the Kong has more preference to a hurdle, because I think a hurdle take some more energy, you have to generate more power because you're only using your legs. Whereas with the Kong, you're spreading out that energy using your arms as well. And it's a pre even like ratio of how much I've not done the like, research into how much like forces are actually put on but to me for me like someone practices and teaches us. It's a pretty 50-50 split, you take off with your legs, you push with your arms, and then you land and it's pretty even. And so I think in terms of conserving energy, so that you can carry on and being as efficient as possible, is important as well. Where in terms of parkour in general, I think a lot of people forget that efficiency isn't just speed. I think it does do both, with speed as like the primary part of that. And then energy conservation as a secondary part.

06-interviewer
Cool. Okay, I think that's everything. Awesome. Okay. Yeah, unless there's anything else that you want to add. That's come to mind. I'll stop the recording.

06-participant
Yeah, no, I'm good.

06-interviewer
I'm good. Okay.
