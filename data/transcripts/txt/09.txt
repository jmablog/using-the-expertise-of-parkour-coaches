09-interviewer
All right, there we go. So, yeah, thank you for coming along. I'm really just looking to talk to kind of parkour coaches around the world, about how they kind of understand some of the movements that we do in parkour considering how it's kind of grown organically and spread throughout the world, but without having like, a rulebook, or like written things that are like, this is what Parkour is, and this is how we do it.

09-participant
Yeah.

09-interviewer
Just kind of seeing how people understand movements, how they coach them, how they think about them a little bit like that. And so I picked the Kong vault, just as kind of a well known move to start with. But I guess the first thing to kind of check with you then is, are you familiar with the term Kong vault? Is that the term that you use?

09-participant
Yes, it is Kong vault. And I'm from Norway. So I we use Kong vault here. But I am also, I also know that it is known as catpass, as well.

09-interviewer
Do you happen to know, erm, do you think there's like, any differences between any of the names? Or is it all just as it's spread around, people use different names at different times?

09-participant
Obviously, I have no idea because I'm, I'm not. It is kind of funny, because you say that you search after parkour coaches? Well, I'm not that experienced coach, nor that I am very experienced athlete. But I think it's just how they name it because, well, you see, in the UK or Norway, they're basically the same moves with different names. So that's basically it. For me at least.

09-interviewer
And just kind of in your own words, how would you kind of describe the Kong vault? It is a very big question. But, just, you know.

09-participant
Yeah. It is a way of overcoming an obstacle with your feet between your hands, I guess. There's, there's so there's so much thing to say about this and at the same I have so little little to say because it's it's basic move. It's just you just overcoming an obstacle that is waist high. But of course, in some cases, it can be lower on or it could be higher.

09-interviewer
So is there, like, how would you kind of I know normally, you know, we'd demonstrate it for coaching, right? How would you kind of just describe that are there are there particular things about it that you go, that's what makes it a Kong vault?

09-participant
Hmm. I guess the power or the height that you get from it, because compared to all the other, stairs, step vaults, speed vaults is like continuing movements, so your chest is on same level, with dash you kind of push yourself, with lazy, you go over to the side, while with kong, you basically kind of fly because you pop off with your hands and you get your chest up. And it's basically compared to fly feeling like you were supposed to launch yourself. And is, and you have also the height differences. So you can start very, very low and then pop yourself very high up and you need to take the impact afterwards.

09-interviewer
Is it, how would you kind of break it down? Are there particular ways to take off for the movement?

09-participant
What do you mean by that?

09-interviewer
So like, just kind of in general, because obviously I know that there's always going to be a bunch of different ways you can do movement, it's you know, it's pretty open but just yeah, I guess thinking about like the basics of it. Are there particular ways that people go into the movement or take off?

09-participant
The basic is, firstly, to look at the object so they wall you're konging or the rail your konging, spot the difference then the distance between yourself and object so firstly, run up how far you're gonna get. So if you have konged, like hundred thousans of walls, you will be, it will be very easy to say like, if you're standing right here, five metres from the wall, you say this is too much power, you can immediately tell it if you come a little bit closer you can spot the optimal place so from there we can start.

09-interviewer
So is there like an optimal distance to be from an obstacle?

09-participant
Yes, you need to spot that. You will learn it after some time after many many times and also somehow you've come as close as possible to the wall and just didn't then just count the steps back or such ago.

09-interviewer
I'm sorry could you just repeat that last sentence because the the internet broke up a little bit.

09-participant
Yeah all right. So you just come as close to the wall as possible and then you count steps going backwards, so take huge steps like if you would just run normally you're just like let me take four steps and then you stop there and this is basically how you would run, you count your steps backwards, and from there you you know how your run up is gonna be so after after you have done your run up you can come a little bit closer to check the wall check the height check the check if you can see the object because sometimes you just can't see it because of the wall you could just go backwards and as you run you need your speed needs to be either increasing so you can slow down or it needs to be increasing and just continuing the speed, you can't slow down. With the last steps you needing to dip down so kinda, um, kind of the horse movement you know how horse gallops it imitates the that kind of movement but you don't, but it can't stop you can't slow down while you're doing it and after that you push push out come up with your chest upright you push out with your arms you straighten your elbows you push with your fingers and you bring your knees up to your chest and straighten out straighten out and then you land.

09-interviewer
So once you're kind of over the obstacle you you extend back out from that knees to chest position.

09-participant
Yes, yes it is because you need to take out the impact and for you to do it you need to extend as much as possible your legs to be able to absorb that impact as much as possible because you if you're gonna have your knees bent then it will then the impact will be much harder to take.

09-interviewer
So you kind of want to end up in almost like a, as if you'd just jumped over the obstacle?

09-participant
Yes.

09-interviewer
And how about if you're trying to like run out of the movement rather than land from like a jump, is it any different or is it just [unclear]

09-participant
It is different. It depends if you're trying to, because if they if there are two walls with the same height let's say hips height then what I have spotted is that there is a difference if you're just kong if you're if you're trying to kong to precision than kong to stride because if you try kong to stride, uh, what I've seen is that you land higher if you do if you do that so I think it is because of the knees. The harder you you take your knees up or so to the chest the more height you're going to get and with the kong it is important that you take a split step before you're taking it taking it so not just punch and going to kong but take a split step and it's basically the same with landing afterwards it is if there is only one wall that you're trying to go over and just flat surface then you will basically try to land first with your left or and then with your right and so on which which one do you take off from.

09-interviewer
To try and land on one foot to keep running?

09-participant
Yes.

09-interviewer
Keep moving, mm. What about, I think you mentioned on the obstacle as well that something about the hands and the fingers?

09-participant
Mm.

09-interviewer
Are they they kind of pushing you off the wall or are they just kind of-

09-participant
With the fingers you basically... what we as as a coach have tried to teach it to the to the other kids to get the motion so if you would stand up right now and go down to the squat and place your hands over your shoulders try to kong from there without straightening your knees, if you would just push as much as possible with your fingers. And this basically it. In, I have, I've written it down, because I have also researched Kongs. And I write a book about it, maybe I want to write a book about I don't know if it will be seen that much. So the Kong is one movement, it's not, it's not like you're going forward and upward, it is one movement, you go straight up. And this is how it it needs to be done, you can't just go first upward, so you can't jump and then place your hands on the obstacle, because then it looks like dive kong. The further you are away from the obstacle, the more it looks like a dive kong. So hypothetically, if you're very close to the wall, you're doing the kong vault best I would say. But you also need to remember that you can't hit your knees on the on the wall.

09-interviewer
I like that diagram, just to kind of put it into words a little bit because I need to transcribe this. It kind of showed a vaulting box. And instead of having like two arrows indicating your motion over it, where you go up and then horizontal. It was just the kind of good example was just the diagonal arrow over the box. It's kind of like a single, single movement.

09-participant
Yes.

09-interviewer
This might be a bit of a strange question, but does the angle of that arrow, that diagonal arrow change, or is there like a perfect angle you want?

09-participant
Not really, it really depends because in some cases, when you don't have a wall and you have a rail, suddenly you're stripped down with the ability to use your hands. So you can use your hands that much. But the rail also have its advantages, so you can grab it. And in some cases when you kong up or the obstacle is is a little bit downwards, you can grab it and pull yourself and so there's this advantage that you don't really have with Kongs on normal walls because you can't grip and grip nothing. So you with I would say with Kongs on walls, you push yourself where in some cases with Kongs on rails, you pull yourself.

09-interviewer
Does that make a difference to kind of other parts of the vault on you know, if you have like a wall or a rail, can you go further on one than the other? Or faster or anything?

09-participant
I would say yeah, yes. You need to be more cautious when you kong on the rails just because you need to... Then there is another thing here just because you need to grab. Grab it really right. I don't know if you can see the hand.

09-interviewer
Oh yeah. Like a, a perfect place on the hand.

09-participant
Yes. So basically, if you have to hand you can't grip your walls huge with just with your finger because then it will fall you can grip obviously here. So you need to just right here.

09-interviewer
Perfect position between the thumb and the index finger.

09-participant
Yes, so you can close, and it's really hard because a rail is very small and very thin. So you can it's very easy to just slip so you need to concentrate instead of concentrating so much on landing which you shouldn't concentrate too much on landing because you need to first it is also shown here. I have so much things with you.

09-interviewer
This is very impressive. Not many other people income with their own research.

09-participant
So this you can see numbers so this is right this is right when you think this is first you first think about run up then here you and the landing. But the things you can't do is first think about run up and then think about landing so you just completely ignore the obstacle here which obviously you can't do you need to think and focus on the things that are that are here. And we can take just almost stunning precision you need a running precision you need to firstly think about your steps because if you don't you're gonna fail fail or just...

09-interviewer
Do you think that's like a common mistake people make, is to worry about the landing on the other side and forget to focus on their takeoff and things?

09-participant
I would say yes sometimes you can see even in some elite high class high class athletes as [name] I believe in there was one video when he was trying kong on the rail to the other the other rooftop and there's and there was a death drop and I knew that he knew that there was this danger that he would slip he he took time and in the end he did it but he had what he mentioned that he slipped actually so it was very close for him to fail so yes I would say it is something I struggled with when I when I tried not particularly kong but other things like standing precision not not saying not running precision so when you're when you're taking running precision with limited steps or with limited place to take to take off it is really important and it teaches you to count your steps and look at your steps first.

09-interviewer
Does the, how can I put this, does the the kind of takeoff for the movement really dictate how the rest of its going to go?

09-participant
Yes absolutely. I don't think you can do a kong diagonally, of course you can but you can't just run forward and then kong to the left or to the right so if you're facing a wall you need to figure out the best possible run up and you can't zigzag your way through so you can't just run like that sometimes you will need to curve it that is possible so when you see that or when you have a wall that you need to kong on and you realise that you don't have enough space so you start with like a banana shape run up this this  just dictates where you're going to go of course if you have that banana run up you won't be won't kong pretty straight you will go to the side but it's I would say that you still if you decide where you want to kong or in which degree you want to turn.

09-interviewer
If, you mentioned having not enough run up for kong for example, is that because you need a certain amount of like speed to get a distance on the other side of the obstacle for something you're trying to land on? Like if you're doing a kong precision?

09-participant
Yes and the speed is important thing so unless there is not enough run up for you to generate the speed from so if you have if you have a wall you can push yourself out to generate more speed sometimes you don't need it because your dip technique is so good that you can generate power from nothing and this is very very nice thing to do very nice challenge do to look at the kong that you know that you can do and you have done it but just take it a step closer just to push yourself just to get that dip down technique even better.

09-interviewer
So I mean if I'm understanding you right you're kind of saying that you can get more power and you know distance in the movement by just you know having a good a good long run up and getting a lot of speed that way or you could get I guess stronger or better at the technique as well and generate similar power from less?

09-participant
Yes because you need to be better at the technique but the thing with speed and with run up it's not only that you need to, you don't only need to have enough run up and then have speed you need to control it because this is the thing that is very very difficult even for me, to be able to control the run up and that and to manage that fear of not bashing your knees into the wall while you're full sprinting and gathering that that force that's the speed that you need to know that you need to have to cover the distance to the obstacle it is very difficult. But I think it also will be manageable after after many tries.

09-interviewer
You mentioned a little bit about, you know, being scary if you're going particularly fast is it? Is the Kong kind of, can it be quite scary movement? You know, diving at a thing-

09-participant
Yes, yes, of course it can be scary, especially if you don't have if you don't have built in the muscle memory that you need to bring your and bring your feet first, because Kong is very different from double Kong, in double Kong, you dive in with your head and your hands first, while with Kong, you take your hands, and you take your feet first. So you're not diving, you're just saying, you're not diving with your head, first, you're diving with your feet first. And in some cases, when there's a lot of speed, you can clip your feet and just go full scorpion, sometimes. Sometimes, you can just forget to, I guess it happens to for beginners that you just forget to bring your feet or just you don't have enough power to bring yourself up. So you clip your feet on the obstacle. Now that also happens.

09-interviewer
Is that a case of not being able to create like enough space for you knees and feet to come up?

09-participant
Yes. And also, sometimes it can be mobility problems. So of course, if the if the person is a beginner, and he won't have that much, and he will, he will struggle to generate that force to push yourself out and to generate space between your chest and your obstacle and the obstacle. So of course, the more space between the obstacle and the chest, the easier it is to bring your feet. And at the same time, you don't need to bring your feet at the same time. So you don't need to just go forward you can take firstly one foot and then the other. And that's what I have seen in my videos of my Kongs that I don't take my feet at the same time just like a feet apart first down there. And then second, but in the end they're, I'm landing with them together with my feet, feet together.

09-interviewer
Is that maybe because of the the staggered step take off, the gallup kind of take off. But you know one foot is going to be in front of the other. So maybe that one comes up first?

09-participant
Yes.

09-interviewer
Because it's it's literally nearer to your chest when you take off right.

09-participant
Yes it's just easier. Yeah, that's the thing. And with the just punch technique is easier to just go up and bring your bring two feet together.

09-interviewer
Do you find that, is it like a difficult move for people to learn? Or? Well, obviously some some people are going to show up and get it straight away. Some people are going to really struggle but just kind of in general?

09-participant
I think it's a it is a mediocre move. For this vault, it is not as easy as step vaults, step vaults everyone can pretty much get it in no time after one training. So it's not a move I recommend learning if you have just started parkour. But it is a move, I think it's a mediocre move. It's kind of easy to get, hard to master. So easy to learn, hard to master, hard to master, I would say.

09-interviewer
So you can you can kind of get the basics of it fairly, not easily, but fairly soon after starting but you can, you can kind of progress that to some really advanced stuff if you wanted to.

09-participant
Because everyone can say yes, I can do a kong pretty much but not everyone can say yes, I can kong on the same two walls 10 feet apart. So.

09-interviewer
Do you find, do you think it kind of lends itself to quite a lot of situations? Is it quite a useful movement in general?

09-participant
I would I would say yes. It is useful. It's not very safe because I would say if I'm trying to run away from from someone, I would much rather use step vault and it is much quicker, much much safer. But if you if you need to launch yourself I think it is quite quite an interesting move to learn.

09-interviewer
Do you think it's like a natural move or do you think it's something that you know people have been invented for parkour a little bit?

09-participant
Hmm.

09-interviewer
Or a bit of both, or something else entirely.

09-participant
I think it is, erm... I think we look at, it is quite similar to monkey, a monkey so I would say so, I haven't seen monkeys move that much but I would say compared to the others it is much more natural I would say so compared to dash for example that looks completely ridiculous is unnatural I would say the way that we launch ourselves to a far wall it looks cool but I don't think I will have ever seen any other, any other animals given do that while, while kong I would say it is quite a, it is quite natural I would say.

09-interviewer
Natural but not necessarily like instinctive maybe? So like people have to learn to do it but it's quite a natural movement once they do.

09-participant
Yes, yes and and also there are many many people that doesn't even need to learn that move, they just they just know it and because they it comes natural naturally-

09-interviewer
So people will- sorry go on.

09-participant
While while some other some others like lazy or step vault even step vault because it is quite confusing with the left arm and arms and feet just by looking at is quite difficult but just by looking you can fairly recreate the kong vault even without having knowledge on parkour on a basic move.

09-interviewer
How um, how did you how did you find learning it, did you find it easy for yourself or was it difficult?

09-participant
It wasn't really that difficult I have been learning parkour I had learned parkour by my coach which is [name], there was a parkour class that I attempted and there was this one training that I missed and it was on basic kongs but after after a week and after that training I just, ehm, I asked what did I miss and then the other coach said that I missed the basically how to do a kong vault and I was like no I like kong so much and he just said okay well do monkey plant on top of this obstacle and I said alright and I've just did it and he just said alright now do a kong and I just did a kong, it is it is completely natural to me but it was really hard really hard to master the dip-up technique I struggle a bit, I didn't understand how it's basically how force would push me back up, I just looked really really weird while trying to learn it it's just these four steps just a matter of these four steps but right now i'm feeling really confident and the thing is also very important that i don't see people doing you can see the quality of the kong just by someone doing a standing kong so if you if you have an obstacle and you just stand 30 or 40 centimetres from the obstacle placing your hands and just doing a standing kong from there you can because then in the air you need to go into that snake move that dip up technique, I have it on the I have it on the video-

09-interviewer
That's okay, because I'm not going to be able to transcribe that for my analysis but if you want to send it to me afterwards I'll be happy to look at it.

09-participant
Yes, I can.

09-interviewer
I mean you mentioned that kind of dip before and I forgot to ask you about it is that you know it seems to be an important part of the movement, what is it kind of adding to the kong vault?

09-participant
Its adding height so you so you can as I said if you don't have that much run up you just need to get better at that dip, that dip up technique. So basically what you're doing your you can already start with, at lower, so you don't need to get high I have it's writing down here. So... right here. So if you start, yeah, if you start high with upright and just upright, you will go down after after Kong. But if you are like not upright, just a little bit downwards, you will generate the force to go up. So same with this here.

09-interviewer
So it's kind of getting you to come down so that you're coming up at the obstacle in your take off so that you're kind of arc over the obstacle is going up rather than... So basically, you're going over the obstacle at the beginning of an arc, rather than at the end of an arc.

09-participant
Yes. So if you see, like a seamless curve, for example, you firstly need to go down to generate force to go up and back again.

09-interviewer
Like a like a regular jump in that you kind of go down to jump up. Yeah.

09-participant
Yes. Just like just like a spring, you just go down just to reach your hands before the obstacles and push with everything you have.

09-interviewer
Yeah. I'm impressed that you have like notes. And you're, you know, thinking about this stuff.

09-participant
Yes I, I actually, I became really interested about that, that research of yours because I kind of do research myself. And basically, what I tend to do is that I tried to write down every single Kong tip that I can ever think of. So everything really from how wide your arms needs to be. While Konging to how your place in your... How do you see, how the positioning of yourself should be in mid air, for example. So everything from basics to pretty advanced?

09-interviewer
And is that stuff that you just kind of develop for yourself by thinking about the movement? Or is it come from your coach, for example, or your community?

09-participant
No, I stopped after two, no after some time, I stopped training parkour with my coach because the class ended basically, it just wasn't an opportunity. And but I still wanted to train parkour. So I hung around with him. And I still do so from we basically became from coach to student from, to friends, just because of that, just because I wanted to train with him more and more. And after that was that I was just sick, I, I didn't have anything to do. It was winter, I couldn't do anything, basically it was Corona. And I just thought that alright, it will be cool to write every single thing, just to just to be a little bit easier to explain, because I know every single thing of this, I know it but it's, it can be hard to explain it, it can be hard to explain explain every single thing, because you know it already to a person that doesn't know it at all. So it is it is kinda it helps me to it helps me to gather every single thing that I ever think of. And at the same time, I've made Insta post for people that if someone else have a tip that I can think of, they can just DM me and that's why I also talking to you because I want to hear a little bit from you. I've asked for tips. And every single tip I've I've basically seen was was the dip down tip, I know is important, but I already have it. I want to have more more tips basically.

09-interviewer
Do you think it's kind of one of the things I've been asking people when I've been talking to this. Do you think you know, sharing that kind of stuff between coaches is, you know, is really useful because a lot of people that I've spoken to, you know, they're kind of coaching from their own experiences. And, you know, would it be a good idea to have something more general out there to say, Hey, this is a good way to coach the Kong. These are some good tips.

09-participant
Yes, absolutely, I would say because this is basically what I want to do afterwards. I want to release it to the public for everyone to see it and it it I would say it also helps coaches because coaches might have experienced that themselves but sometimes students have different approaches to different things to different to different tricks and it would be the same with kong there are different parts there are different approaches to kong learning kong and that may that are that may be good every single one of them but it's not sure that they're actually some of some of those different people we have different possibilities to learn different moves I don't know how to, how to describe it, for me it will be very easy to learn a kong for you it will it could be very hard and one coach could say you just do a kong while the other coach might explain it a little bit better so I think it would help coaches to learn a better and different ways to learn a kong.

09-interviewer
Yeah I mean everyone's going to like say have their own individual student journeys.

09-participant
Yes and and different tips on the kongs as well so that's why I'm trying to gather as much as possible because you may have some common tips that I've never think of think of and I might have some others. Both might be really useful but they doesn't need to be useful for that specific group of peoples they could develop their own way to teach kong for example.

09-interviewer
Do you think you know that that is there is potentially a risk though with that kind of approach that it starts to become too formal that you know you might go well this is the way we teach the kong and actually kind of it starts locking it down too much? Or do people need to be able to experiment a bit?

09-participant
Yes I don't think there is a specific way of learning... okay there is a specific way of learning everything for example when backflip and kong and everything but different people will have different approaches and whatever approach suits them if the end if the end goal is that they will learn it it doesn't really bother me so if the coaches have a different approach to learning a kong, if it in the end leads to learn kong vault it's I'm okay with that. There will be some ground rules that you need to apply so for example you need to push up with your arms and dip down and so on and so on but other than that you can explore experiment yourself as long as you see the progress.

09-interviewer
I like I like that I did like so so what are some of those kind of like things that that have to be there for it to be a kong vault? You know if there's all these different variations and things you do dive kongs and double kongs and all that stuff what's kind of what makes a kong kind of recognisable as a kong?

09-participant
You can't go to the side so I've seen people that just kong and don't do it quite well so they, they bring their feet to the side over with your with one arm so they don't lean forward as much as possible this this is a thing everyone needs to be familiar with to have a pretty recognisable kong you can learn with punch punch technique you can learn with step two step technique both will be equally right but the other one will be not as efficient as the other one but I think yeah this is I would say this is basically it as long as you have your hands on obstacle you push out with your hands and you lean forward and then of course bring your feet afterwards as long as you do that it is pretty recognisable as kong.

09-interviewer
And um, are there are there like particular things, I think you might have mentioned a little bit about this already. But are there particular things that you look for to say, that was a good Kong or that was a bad Kong? You know, particularly when you're coaching, are there things that you find that you have to help people with a lot, or?

09-participant
Yes, I see. Sometimes kids use use their feet too much. So when they're trying to learn kong on the on the ground, it is important that you see if they're using their hands too much, or if they you're using their feet much are good Kong will rely on hands very much because you can, this is basically where where you can get their power, you can get their power from legs as well, it will help a lot if you have power, with legs, but their hands is equally as important. So you will, you will see clear difference between kids that, that rely on hands, and that rely on feet, that those that rely on feet just bounce like a frog and just they just tap the wall, just basically top of the with, with hands generating no power, while the other pushes themselves up. And this is what you're looking for. That they're that they can push themselves out, and not just tap the wall. Because it wouldn't work with higher wall. Of course, well, when we are teaching we're we're focusing on ground level and based on maybe 20-30 centimetres up on the bench on the bench. But the next step there is to try on the higher obstacle and then it won't work.

09-interviewer
Is there is there like an obstacle that's too high for the Kong? Is there like a maximum height as well as... you could do it on the floor, almost but is it-

09-participant
Yes.

09-interviewer
Where does it kind of become too high?

09-participant
I think it is up to each individual. Because I've seen people do Kongs that are extremely hard at like, our like head height, the same of their head, and then just and they Kong up I have no idea how they do it. I have I'm not familiar with that level. But I know it's possible. So I don't know, it is, I guess you need to check your boundaries. And if you know your boundaries, you can always break them.

09-interviewer
I guess if if you can jump and kind of get your hands on top of the thing, there's always a chance.

09-participant
And pull yourself up [laugh]

09-interviewer
Is this um, does strength play a role in the kong? In that case.

09-participant
Yes, I think strength plays a role, but technique is much more important. So without technique, you just wouldn't be able to, I would say technique is what makes it look smooth. And so it makes this is what the makes Kong look like bread and butter just like flowing like, like, like you can see a person without even touching it. You can see the person just flowing or flying, while with more power based with little technique. You will see the person go further. But it will be a little bit on I don't know, like seeing a beautiful scenario in 15 frames per second I would say. If you know what I mean? Yeah, a little bit hacky. You can see with power and without controlling technique, you will you won't be able to use 100% of your power. But with a good technique and with low strength you are using every single strength that you have. But you're using it 100% of your power. Even if you're probably is like 40% you're using 100% of that 40%. But if you have a power based Kong without technique, you're using 40% of that 100% power that you have. So you see the differences here.

09-interviewer
Yeah, I see what you're saying. And so that kind of like flow is quite important to the movement? Like a consistent speed throughout?

09-participant
Yes, it is. Speed is very important. I have another thing written in the book here. That said speed needs to be constant. So so you can see the speed like, like you're increasing and then the dip comes and-

09-interviewer
Okay, yeah. So as as someone's coming in for their kind of two step gallop they they put the brakes on a little bit.

09-participant
Yes. And this is thing that you it is not not real, not not optimal. This is also okay to do to just have speed increasing and then just holding the speed so so you can slow down, but you can surely increase speed as you go.

09-interviewer
Yeah, so either keeping a consistent speed or accelerating right up to the point that you take off.

09-participant
Yes, yes. And I was and I find accelerating easier to control for me at least. So if I'm going for higher Kong and or longer Kongs, it is easier to control them. And with the Kongs where, where you're trying to increase or maximise your run, you need to watch out your steps to them. So they don't sound like you're running with a 30 kilogramme backpack, on your on your shoulders, there needs to be gentle and you don't need it. You don't want to have that. That loud step I would say, it needs to be fairly silent, as well as the takeoff. You don't want to slap that you need to push yourself. Now of course with higher speed, and if you're trying to join high speed, there will be a sound because it was just it just happens so fast. But-

09-interviewer
Do you mean with the hands? The hands on the obstacle?

09-participant
Yes. Yeah, it's with the hands on on the obstacle. If you're when you're trying to Kong it and the hands on are on the obstacle. I this this is only this is the thing that I have found. That is that the volume doesn't it doesn't need to be that much high. I mean, how would I describe it.

09-interviewer
Is that also sorry to interrupt, but is that also just kind of a, to try and avoid injury, you know, you don't want to be like slapping-

09-participant
Yes.

09-interviewer
-slamming into this obstacle too hard, you know.

09-participant
And also, it means that your technique is not that good. Because as I said, if you just slap it, it means that you're using more power, and you're not using your whole fingers. While if you just slap a little bit in higher speeds, you will slap it, and you will hear sound but not that high sound that you will if if you don't have the, the technique.

09-interviewer
Just to kind of describe that gesture you just made, is that kind of rolling from the base of the hand through to the fingers and then pushing off the fingers?

09-participant
Yes. So basically, you're placing your whole hand and then just pushing out. I have also it's written down here. So you can just find it... I have many things down here. So this is actually a scene taken from the book. This this is the only thing that I haven't imagined myself, which is coming from the book. Max Barker's book, the wild thing in the wild world.

09-interviewer
I'm not familiar with that book.

09-participant
Yeah, you can, but at the end of that book, it is it is auto biography. But at the end of that book, you will see some kong tips and one of them is to use your hand and I have basically just taken, taken it there, there are some other tips such as dip down of course, there is tip to use your arms. Tip three, try and try again. To have your to have your chest upright, as you see here. And extra tip four that says one undershoot one overshoot and the third will be a stick. Not always. But that's how. That's the sum of words. And I I have been left unsatisfied, with this because Kong is so much more than just those four tips. So this is only this is this also thing that pushed me to write that book.

09-interviewer
Just because I'm curious why, why does that talk about having your chest upright? What does that benefit?

09-participant
Because if you, if you do a Kong and you have your chest curved, you will go out face first, you will go out a little bit face forward, you need to have that upright to gain that momentum to have good posture while mid air. So you can spot everything so you can see. And also, if you have your chest a little bit downwards, you will slightly go down, you will go a little a little bit down. But in if if there's a battle of height that you tried to kong on the same walls that are very far away, you need to push up and get that power. And for for you, to need to be able to do that you need to straighten your chest and to have the chest upright.

09-interviewer
So it's about kind of your body position when you come out of the movement, setting up-

09-participant
Yes, body position in mid air is also very important. I've written the same here.

09-interviewer
Okay, so it's kind of you know, where you're looking perhaps, or where your, or where your head is going is kind of where the rest of you is going? A little bit?

09-participant
Yes, yes, yeah. Sometimes when you dive too much, so when you push a little bit more with your head. So it's a do a little bit of the the double Kong technique, you will curl your chest because the thing you do when you're curling is that you bring your need to bring your feet, it will be hard to be to bring your feet more up, because when you're in this position, it will be hard to squeeze your feet. While if you're in this position, it will be much easier to do that. And this is also the the thing the balance you have. So if you're battling with a Kong that is very far away and on the same height, you can check that. So if you if you do a kong and you have curled, and you should spot on the camera you have curled back, it means that you have very much too much power too much run up and too little push, push up. And if you have good push, you will see the chest but if you don't land on the wall, exactly, it will mean that you need to have a little bit more speed. So that lasts between speed. And then the push up as I said earlier it is it needs to be a continuing movement up not up and then just.

09-interviewer
I guess it's kind of similar to what you're saying about the takeoff in if you're if you push too hard with the hand and hands are slapping too much things like that. They're also kind of putting the brakes on a little bit. Right? You want that consistent movement over the obstacle.

09-participant
Yes.

09-interviewer
So it's kind of that chest up thing is kind of about making sure you're not over rotating when you're diving forward. And you know just landing on your head essentially.

09-participant
Yes because this is a thing that I have. I'm too good at because I have struggles to do double Kong. I can't do other it, I haven't learned it yet. But I am very good at the simple Kongs. And since this is the fact that I have burned, written down or burned in my heart that I know every single muscle memory of that Kong so every time I tried to do a double Kong, I just immediately do I just bring my feet first because I've had it written down my muscle memory is so good. But it is good. It keeps me from injuring myself. So I sometimes I have felt sometimes that when I'm even in this position because something happens to me. I can manage to squeeze my abs even more and land with my feet. It is also very important and something that I find really useful. So when you're in that position that that you feel that you have curled your back, to squeeze extra your abs to bring your feet higher.

09-interviewer
I'm curious as well, because you mentioned about one of the tips in that book being one where you overshoot where one more you undershoot or something like that. And then one where you get it perfect.

09-participant
Yes, that was the was the Max Barker. Yeah, I haven't really, I haven't written it down in my book. But it was that you overshoot one Kong and you undershoot and you know that, you know, the forces that are applied, and when you're over shooting and shooting, so you can measure it.

09-interviewer
So it's a case of just kind of figuring out how much power you need to put in to land on the thing you want to land on.

09-participant
Yes.

09-interviewer
Okay.

09-participant
It of course it does, it doesn't work when you have a death drop on the other side, then you need to slowly check and slowly if you're, if there's no way of overshooting, you need to undershoot let's just have a little bit more power, undershoot, but just a little bit more power, and eventually, you will stick it, you will find that balance.

09-interviewer
And I guess as well just kind of doing lots of different Kongs to different distances and different obstacles over time you build up that experience to be able to judge the power in something brand new that maybe you haven't done before but you go ah, this looks similar to this other one. And so you don't really go through that.

09-participant
Especially on different heights. And this is where we're just this thing comes to my mind that you can basically stand anywhere from a wall and you can check Alright, I can kong from here, okay, not from here, but all right from here. And this is also thing you can teach with your students or with your, this is the thing I have tried with my friend that you just place a person away from a wall, that is that you feel it just places somewhere from the wall, and they will try to kong it the way that you have tried. So you just you describe the way that this run up needs to be done. Just to bring different problems. And because it if you have similar problems that you need to curve around to get more speed or dip down a little bit more, or something else, it will be really useful.

09-interviewer
To just kind of it's kind of the whole point of this study in a way is seeing that there's a lot of variations you can do for these things. But there's like a core part of it, that kind of stays the same, and then things change around. Is that what you think? Do you think that's fair to say?

09-participant
Yes, because Kong is just a move. Kong is a move that there are set rules that needs to be done for it to be called Kong, good Kong. And the thing that changes its environment. And you can do on 100 Kongs or standard Kongs where the wall is like this, and you need to come on the on the edge. So, if you have for example, here, this this is seen from from, right, if it, for example, seeing from over and if this is you into Kong like this.

09-interviewer
Right, so kind of going into a corner.

09-participant
Yes. So instead of placing your both hands on one wall you're placing two hands on two different walls. Yeah. And, and you need to learn to kong like that, for example, you will have more space for your feet. So this will be a little bit different. But it's it's the same move. It's just a kong.

09-interviewer
Yeah. Yeah, the same is the environment changes, but the move adapts and stays the same. Yeah.

09-participant
It's yeah, the movement that adapts. It's the same with rails. You can't use your hands that much to push yourself out because you need to grab it. But then you can pull yourself a little a little bit better if this is a Kong or a wall that you need to land on that is lower, but a little bit apart. That you will have no problem just Kong on a regular wall. But it's a rail, you can kind of push yourself out. I mean pull yourself for that [unclear]

09-interviewer
And you know, you've got things you've come up with, but you mentioned as well, you're looking for, you know, more tips and then other coaches, perspectives on the movement and stuff. Is there anything in particular that you'd like to know more about the kong vault or anything you feel like you don't understand yet you'd like to know more about?

09-participant
Yes. It is, Konging on higher walls, then. So if this if this there is a wall that is this height, and the other wall or wall that you try to land on that is higher? I haven't experimented with. I haven't tried, I haven't tried it yet.

09-interviewer
So actually, the hands for the Kong are on a wall, but then the wall you're trying to land on is higher than that wall?

09-participant
Yes. So this is the thing I, I wonder, because then the first thing is this. It needs to be a little higher. So instead of that pointing thing to be just-

09-interviewer
So it changes your angle of that diagonal arrow we talked about earlier? Yeah.

09-participant
Yeah.

09-interviewer
And you think that that changes the movement?

09-participant
I will say yes, a little bit because then it's not that distance based. It's more power based or up based. Because if you see long Kongs, it's more distance base. If you see if you take the double, double Kong, really a good double come from [name], this iconic double Kong in Denmark, I would say he had tremendous power and tremendous run up, he needed to take, he just full sprint and had this whole parking lot and even this wasn't enough. So he stepped through over the wall and then proceeded to sprint full power. So but it this is just distance of here it is a little bit higher. So the higher we go, the more it looks just like standing, standing jump with your hands. Hypothetically, hypothetically. Yeah.

09-interviewer
So it becomes more like an up and down movement rather than that arc, that horizontal-

09-participant
Yeah. But but it is just as we go a little bit higher. But if you are like, here, don't think that changes is that you need, you need to go higher. So you need to bring your knees higher, and you need to bounce higher, you don't need that much momentum, on that much run up because it's not that far. Its just height.

09-interviewer
Yeah, so there's like, there's like a certain amount of height change that can kind of be okay, and not make too much difference. But then, beyond a certain point, it starts to affect how you do it.

09-participant
Yeah, yes. And at the same time, if you have two walls that are really, really, really, really far. There is no way you could kong it.

09-interviewer
So you're you're kind of you're you're kind of landing, whatever you're trying to exit the movement kind of does kind of affect the rest of it as well. It's not like you can just do a kong and then deal with wherever you land on, you kind of have to take that into consideration when you're setting yourself up to do them.

09-participant
Yes, because if you should try to a kong that are far away, you need to straighten yourself out. But if you try to do a kong up, you need to bring your feet higher. So you you will need to go in a squat position. Sometimes if there's a very big height difference.

09-interviewer
You mentioned [name]. And like what is it about guys like him, and people that do these really, really advanced Kongs or really really high level kong. Do you think, what is it do you think that they're doing that lets them do that? Is it just experience, is it, are they doing it different? Or is it just they're really they're just able to commit to it? I mean, you mentioned being able to really sprint really, really hard. And I think you mentioned earlier about you know, taking that ability to sprint and not slowing down. Are they just really good at like really going fast and really holding on to that?

09-participant
You're asking a question that I also want to ask.

09-interviewer
[laugh]

09-participant
But but yes, I would say I would say, being able to control full sprint run up, it helps a lot. Having having that instinct. So if you try to kong, having that instinct to build up muscle memory that you know that you will save yourself having to know, splat or crane to build to be able to safely do a Kong over and over again, is also really, really important. knowing the difference between overshoot and undershoot. So knowing how much force you will need to apply for a different kong, which comes from experience. So experienced technique. I don't know this, it could be some something some oomph, that they have, or something that they have that they also want to know. But I don't know. I, I don't know.

09-interviewer
Cool. Um, so I've we've kind of gone through a lot of the questions I like to try and hit with people, which is great. Is there anything else that like popped into your head or you've thought of that you, that we didn't get a chance to go over or anything you you'd like to add? Before we finish.

09-participant
Um, maybe the last thing I've written in books, right now, I don't have that many pages. I can go through some interesting things, things. So imagining yourself during the move, of course, it's very, very important. If there is a danger involved, you need to imagine yourself doing the move, which also helps a lot. Imagine yourself how you would do it, which also applies to the other tricks or flips as well. To be, to stay to be able to stay committed while you're running. So the other thing I've seen that people commit then when you stand when they start run up, and when they takeoff, they're just like oh no, it was a terrible mistake. If you come if you commit you need to stay committed the whole time. And you can just take take your mind but I think it is also important in not just kong but else in other other things. And it just there's a drawing here forces applied when they're grabbing a rail.

09-interviewer
Yeah, so the pull on the rail rather than being pushed with the flat hand.

09-participant
Yeah. And reps for Kongs. It is also very important to have written a little bit more here. So monkey plant on top, precision on top. My imagining of course. Doing a Kong beside the wall is also just to check if you have the height.

09-interviewer
Okay, yeah.

09-participant
Bounce back with, but then you need to have the right angle, you can't just come off from it you need to actually push yourself out. Same yeah, same Kong different spot without it can be similar or just the run up.

09-interviewer
So kind of giving people experiences that let them get used to the-

09-participant
Yes.

09-interviewer
-movement without actually doing it.

09-participant
Because every single thing you do you can build up to with reps or and also, the thing I have forgot to mention here is split step. So if this if there is a wall that is fairly low to the ground, you can land with your one foot on the obstacle and with one foot on the ground.

09-interviewer
Yeah, so just yeah, just giving people maybe less intimidating ways to practice it.

09-participant
Instead of just going for it and breaking yourself when you practice this different splatbacks or different Kong. Kong preps you also build a muscle memory to catch yourself if you even if you don't have planned it in the future and this is this is a thing I see my generation so I'm 17 versus the other people's the Imax generation of kids I would say people in my age that just try konging then I remember this one person that have break their heel because they overshot Imax this iconic kong at Imax we just the thing that happened that's obviously you don't want to undershoot so he over shooted and completely missed the wall landed on on the surface afterwards and I think this is this is really stupid of course you have some people like Max Barker that 14 have done it and this is the thing I want if this is the thing i'm struggling to understand because at some in some cases we would call those people monsters they're obviously obviously humans so there needs to be a way that said that they have done it.

09-interviewer
Is that you know just to just to be clear like monster in terms of like-

09-participant
Because it is really-

09-interviewer
Really good athletes like kind of monstrously good.

09-participant
Yes, because it is incredible or impossible that they have achieved this thing at such a young age and to-

09-interviewer
So it's kind of like natural talent?

09-participant
Sometimes yes yes I would say yes the talent is talent is a part of it but also Max have a trained parkour in key, he didn't just go there and they just tried it he had he knew how to prepare he knew how to have done kongs before he he was familiar with kongs it is yeah so so obviously preparation and talent, I don't know I know about about talent.

09-interviewer
It's tricky because yeah obviously people... you can kind of say like, oh they're just very talented and it almost dismisses the hard work that obviously goes into these things.

09-participant
Yes, yes, that that's why I don't want to use that oh they're just talented yeah and same with same with Max split precision first flip precision to rail, I don't know if this was done I don't, I don't think so, I don't know. I have no idea but in the long run it is better to hard work beats talent that's it so in the long run even if I don't commit if I were to stand before Imax right now I could judge if I was good enough to do it if I feel strong enough or if I don't, even even if I don't do it now or commit to it now tomorrow after month or after a year I'm only 17 I have so much more years to do it and this is the thing that those people don't see I will say they just sometimes it's because of their environment sometimes it is because of other coaches encouraging just yeah come on come on just do it you have the power and so on so it really depends.

09-interviewer
Yeah it's it's good that you can kind of stay aware of your own abilities and judge sensibly if you should try something or not.

09-participant
Because the only person that can judge if you're able to do it or not is you yourself, and no one should tell you otherwise.

09-interviewer
Yeah. Okay cool, yeah unless there's anything else you want to add I'm happy that we've gone through everything pretty much that I need to go through and I'll stop the recording unless there's anything you want to say.

09-participant
I was, I was kind of curious how many people have you interested interviewed so far or how many people are-

09-interviewer
Uhm, I can tell you a bit more about that stuff but I'll stop the recording first.
