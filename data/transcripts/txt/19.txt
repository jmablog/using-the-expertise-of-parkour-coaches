19-interviewer
There we go. So as... Yeah, as the information sheet said, Really, I'm just looking to talk to parkour coaches, about the Kong vault. Because I'm interested in how we've come to understand it in our sport as it's kind of spread around and how people learnt it, and how people coach it to other people as well. Considering that we kind of have this deregulated sport that doesn't have a central organisation or rulebook or something like that. So we're kind of seeing how these things have spread. But I guess the first thing to kind of check then is, is the term Kong vault familiar to you? Is that the terminology you use for the movement?

19-participant
Yeah, like most of the time, but through the course of the time, I, I think that I came across, like many or much more variations of the name, but most the time I use just the kong, because I guess it's the most common one. And it's just very simple.

19-interviewer
Great. And how would you describe the movement?

19-participant
So basically, is it's really similar to the one in gymnastics through the obstacle, but I don't know the name of it in gymnastics. So I know the Slovak name, but I'm not sure in English. So this is the problem. But we had to move on how we can how would I describe in different way? So, yeah, if it is vaults, it's vaults, it's in that category of moves. Like, it is much more different to the climbing stuff and all the things, and in probably, in comparison to the most of the other vaults, it's, you jump off from two feet at the same time, goes like speed, dash, and all of this are from the one. So I guess the biggest difference, I would say?

19-interviewer
So you mentioned it's part of like a group of vaults?

19-participant
Yeah.

19-interviewer
What what kind of obstacles might they be used on? Or what might they be used for?

19-participant
And these are good questions, actually. Because I don't think that I, I casually think about these things. I don't know, it's it's really universal, I would say, because most of the time you can you can use it... in a sense, there are lots of variations of Kong, you can you can use it in different ways on different materials, obstacles, rails, walls, I don't know, I used to do those in the school, through the desks [laugh] when I started, so I guess you can almost anywhere, because even you can do drops, like from the same level dropping by Kong on to the low level. So I guess I don't know. I've already seen lots of stuff.

19-interviewer
Are there any that are more common, or something it's used for like a lot?

19-participant
Maybe a diving Kong? Or is it's, it's really, really good. And in order to, in order to overcome a longer obstacle, right? Because it's just more practical in that sense, that you throw yourself out there and, and you can manage it, in a way that you overcome that obstacle.

19-interviewer
And if you were going to, like, how would you describe the movement, like what does it look like? What, are there anything about it that when someone you know is doing parkour, say you're watching someone do a kong? How do you know that they've done a kong versus another vault, like what what kind of makes it look like a kong?

19-participant
So there, there's that symmetry that both hands, place on the obstacle at the same time. And you push from the obstacle by both hands, to just try to centre yourself in a way that you lands safely so, and it does, I don't know, it just has its, you know, that essence, that uniqueness that you just know that it is a kong [laugh]

19-interviewer
It's it's one of the things that I'm curious about, because, like I said at the start, there's no like rulebook that says, This is what a Kong is. So I'm really curious how people define it for themselves. You know, particularly if you're coaching, you kind of have to say, well, we I'm going to teach you how to do this movement. So what is it that you teach to them? You know, does that make sense?

19-participant
Yeah, I know, what you're trying to, like, what point are trying to make. So basically, this, anytime you teach anything, you can show it straight away. And it's, it's just so clear, then. So you don't have to be so I would say, like, good with your wording, in that sense. But I think most of the time I teach basically anything, but even with the Kong is that I try to point the, those specific points of the move. So there's a there's a jump off, there's a, the actual wall. So you jump on your hands first, and then you push from that, and there's a landing. And what sorts of things that you need to think about through the whole process. So like to have, you know, just that, that position when you...

19-interviewer
Yeah, I mean, I know it's difficult, because obviously, when you're coaching normally you can demonstrate, right? Because I need to put this into text, I kind of need something in words [laugh]

19-participant
[laugh] This is a struggle now. Yeah.

19-interviewer
And I just want to point out as well, you know, it popped into my head, it's okay if, how can I put this, if, like, you don't have like an answer to something. So if I say like, what defines a Kong, and you're like, well, I don't know, it just is.

19-participant
I'm just trying to, like, it's part of the, part of the answer is actually me thinking out loud, you know, so I'm trying to make something but maybe it can fail in the process [laugh] So there's the thing.

19-interviewer
And I found it interesting in that, that you kind of described about the points you try and talk people through when you're coaching with them. Can you give me a bit more detail about some of those points? Are there like, things that you if you say, I'm going to teach a Kong in a, in a class or something, you know, the things you think about teaching?

19-participant
Maybe that's methodology is just try to break that complex thing into simpler pieces. So, so I know that I need to focus on the jump off then on the hands then on the landing, then we can, from that point, then we can try to, like, fix some of the details. Because then, most of the time, when we, when we go through these things, with the students with the children, or anybody, there's something like, there are there going to be mistakes, and I just try to watch and, and go through, go through them in the process.

19-interviewer
I mean, it would be quite good. If if we could go through maybe those you know, you describe takeoff, hands on the obstacle and landing. Maybe if we go through each of those, that would be really, really helpful. So with the takeoff are there, are there certain ways to take off for the movement or...?

19-participant
Okay, so we can just go as as I will teach you basically, yeah. So like the first move for me or the first essential thing for the Kong is that takeoff from the both feet, from in the same time. And, and there's that split take off, that is being done, and it's it's just a hard move. Many times for, for the beginners because because when you see that move are being done from the from the splits take off, they don't see it in that way, they just see that the one foot is in the air bit earlier than the other one. So they just think that it is actually from the one foot but it's not like that at all. I think and I teach that the technique, it's, it's not about that, so we just tried to, like a simple exercise, like stepping from the one foot to both, and then just jump in the air, like vertical jump. And to memorise that and to optimise it, then we can use it in, in that in the technique. So yeah, there's a first thing. Then, most of the time, it's kind of a simple thing to go through a side vault or two hander, if you know what I mean. And because it's a similar thing, but there's not that, so there's, that's another difference between Kong and other things, and especially with with this side vault is that your legs go through the space that you have between your hands. And sometimes it is just like changing the side vault into the Kong vault, because it's basically almost the same. But the difference is just in the hands position and the legs position. So, so most, many times I, I just pointed out that it's really similar to that, they all, all they need to do is just to make it like a straight line. So they don't position themselves diagonally, or something like that. And then we try to do some exercises, to, to emphasise that pushing motion from the both hands. And then with there will be a monkey plant or we call it like then. So when you use a kong, but just to jump on the wall, and stop on that level. Because this is basically a same same thing as Kong, but you just don't finish the vault, basically. Or it is a Kong in some sense. But there's don't, that there's not that feeling or that fear that you that you stumble over the obstacle, and you fall. So it's really good for the beginners to just try to, to thrust the obstacle a bit more, if they if they actually, if they find out that they can jump on, and then jump over that. There will be another one. I mean, landing is just as much as most of the time it's not a problem because landing is, it's not a specific technique. It's just for me, it's like and habit, you know, to be suggestion to go on to to some to, not to fall, basically [laugh] That's the thing, I don't know what else... then I would just make the the points about the individual like because some sometimes there's a problem that they don't believe that they can push from the obstacle. So they tried to compensate it by lifting just one hand. So maybe they need to return to that pushing motion and try those monkey plants a bit more. Or there's a problem with a takeoff that they try to take off from the one foot so we need to work on that again. So yeah, it's this process of watching and trying again, doing it repeatedly.

19-interviewer
I, I made a few notes as you went through that. So just to kind of go back to the take off for a second. So when you say the split foot takeoff. So, it's kind of similar to a lot of what I've heard from other people, which is, you know, people start out taking off both feet at the same time, kind of like a jump.

19-participant
Yeah.

19-interviewer
But then you transition into taking off from split feet. 

19-participant
Yeah.

19-interviewer
But you're saying it's not, it's not like you're just running and you just keep running, it still kind of goes into like, you're still jumping off two feet, just the feet are split, is that right?

19-participant
Yeah, I understand it in that way. It's just smoother in that way. Because you, you don't have that impact by jumping on the both feet in this in the same time. Because you can like, that energy is is going a bit smoother in that way. But that that pushing motion in your legs, I guess is it would be probably more in the in the front leg, because it's up front but, it's like the pushing is actually is in the same time with both feet. So that's, that's how I understand it.

19-interviewer
So it just feels like a smoother transition-

19-participant
Yeah, yeah.

19-interviewer
-Into the rest of the movement.

19-participant
That's basically the thing. So the split take off is, yeah, it's just as you said, it is a smoother transition from the running to actually jumping. Yeah.

19-interviewer
Does that difference affect the rest of the movement? Does it make a difference to how you perform the rest of the kong? Or is it just a nicer take off?

19-participant
I mean, it just, is that one detail that when you master it, you just can you just can jump longer distances. Because it's, it doesn't take you that speed from from from running through to the obstacle. Yeah.

19-interviewer
So it'll lets you maintain your speed better.

19-participant
Yeah. Yeah that's the thing.

19-interviewer
To go further in the vault. Okay. And then, so, you mentioned the two hander? Did I get that right?

19-participant
Yeah. It's, is the same thing, like so many variations of the name, so I just use whatever one.

19-interviewer
I've heard, I've heard that. I wasn't familiar with it before. But I've heard that from a few other people in the in these interviews. So is that essentially you're doing a kong bt you're allowing the legs to come around the side a bit more rather than staying straight between the hands? Is that right?

19-participant
Yeah, it, yeah, we can, like we can look at it from the perspective of Kong or the side vault. So if we're talking about side vault, it's basically Kong but it's taking the legs around and if if you're talking around, the other way around, so Kong is basically side vault but you are straight.

19-interviewer
Okay. So the kind of basic pattern of hands only on the obstacle, and I guess knees coming to chest to kind of tuck you up.

19-participant
Yeah.

19-interviewer
And then passing over the obstacle. It's just whether you're kind of passing sideways or straightforward, right.

19-participant
Yeah, that's it.

19-interviewer
Okay. And when you talked about pushing on the obstacle as well, is that to create space on top of the obstacle for the legs to come through?

19-participant
Yeah, that's the point of the motion because if you let your hands all the way all the time in the place, you are going to stumble and fall so okay, you need to do that, yeah.

19-interviewer
So it's more about just kind of clearing the obstacle and having enough space to do that kind of pushing yourself away from it.

19-participant
Yeah, exactly.

19-interviewer
How about, does pushing on the obstacle contribute to distance or anything like that? I know some people have described that to me. Or do you find it's just to create that space?

19-participant
I think that in dive Kongs and, and regular ones, it's just to clear this space just to make you go through but in double Kong, the first takeoff, the hands actually help you to to make it longer so far, and I'm not sure about kong to precision, how much it affects the actual distance or efficiency of the vault, but but most of the time and the main function, I would say that it is to make the space for you.

19-interviewer
So is that about getting your chest up, to come through to create that space? Or just lifting yourself away from the obstacle?

19-participant
I think lifting yourself like the whole body, you know? So just a bit higher from the obstacle.

19-interviewer
How about with the hips coming up? I've heard some people talk about needing to get their hips pretty high up. Is that something that you think about in konging, or coaching?

19-participant
Yes, sometimes I point it out when, because I am, I don't know exactly how much you need to have those hips, like high but but it's is a thing that, because you need to have your weight or a really significant amount of your of your weight on your hands. Because then you can push that weight and make that make the space available. So and sometimes beginners tend to be a bit scared to do that. They need to some, or they don't know that there's need to be this kind of more energy into the takeoff to be a bit more higher. So sometimes I pointed out that they can try to focus on that a bit more. Sometimes they that help helps, because they just tried to be a bit higher. And then they we could say like they need to push from those hands, because it's just the one option or they will fall, something like that.

19-interviewer
You, I think you mentioned when you're talking about the... I've forgotten the phrase, you refer to it as a monkey up, or monkey...?

19-participant
Monkey plants.

19-interviewer
Monkey plant.

19-participant
I don't know. Yeah, I just, I just heard it.

19-interviewer
That's all good. Yeah, I mean, like you say, there's names, there's all sorts of names for everything but I just, you know, I want to use the one that you're familiar with. That's all. That, you know, it's to help people get used to the movement without a drop on the other side.

19-participant
Yeah.

19-interviewer
Is that, you know, do you consider that the movement, particularly maybe as a coach? Is it something that's a bit scary for people to learn?

19-participant
It's actually for me, as I said, it's actually to get rid of that fear in an actual Kong, because you can do it's actually on the longer obstacles. And you can imagine that if that obstacle is a bit, a bit thinner and you would, and your feet lands in that imaginable space a bit further, then you can say to yourself, I actually can do that over a thin obstacle. So.

19-interviewer
So it's giving people a chance to practice the technique. without worrying about that.

19-participant
Yeah, without that possible consequences.

19-interviewer
Is that something that you found people might worry about a lot?

19-participant
Yes, I think so. Because most of the time, they just they're good enough to do the vault. And they quite experienced, experienced for beginners. But there's that there's that something that they don't know how to how to overcome. Because it is kind of different, because there's no other motion that they can kind of avoid that. Because when you have the side vault or lazy vault, you can just go around with it but in the kong vault you just need to push and hope that your feet won't touch on the obstacle.

19-interviewer
Yeah. So there's like a degree of commitment to the movement.

19-participant
Yeah.

19-interviewer
You know, once you decide to do it, you can't change your mind [laugh]

19-participant
[laugh] Yeah, exactly.

19-interviewer
Yeah. And then so you mentioned landing as well that you don't worry too much about teaching landings when you're doing kongs.

19-participant
Yeah like specifically to Kongs, because landings is like a general thing that you need to master but then it is kind of not the point which is just really crucial to the Kong itself.

19-interviewer
Yeah. So you'd like, if you learn to do a good landing from just a jump, you can just do that from a kong.

19-participant
Yeah, if you can do good precisions and rolls and if you're just strong enough to do these things, I think that it will just adapt to the vault itself.

19-interviewer
How about for coming out of a kong, like running? Is that any different? Or is it the same, you just learn how to kind of land and run? I'm thinking if you're trying to connect it to another movement.

19-participant
Yeah, I know, what you aiming for. Yeah, so um, that's the thing that we teach, or I teach in, basically with any other vault, that there's an option to, to land on both of your feet, or just the one and you can run, then, but I don't think it's something specific that I can teach you somehow to land on that one foot, and you magically will run away. It's just something from your intuition. And it's just something I don't know, if I've ever taught anyone to specifically do anything to, to land on the one foot, but basically, most of the time it is it is almost the same thing. As with the takeoff, so it's a smoother transition to running. So it's just like the starting point.

19-interviewer
So it's maybe not, you know, exactly. linked to the Kong vault technique itself. It's just kind of what you have to do after doing a kong, but you can learn that for any movement.

19-participant
Yeah.

19-interviewer
Yeah, I see what you're saying. I mean, having said that, is there anything about the Kong that you have to think about, when you're doing, perhaps the part on the obstacle with your hands, to set you up for a good landing? You know, is or is there a way you can do a Kong where you can have a bad landing?

19-participant
Yeah, I would say that you can, you can start to have a rotation in the [unclear], or sometimes when the running to the obstacle is slow, or if it is too fast, they, you either go heads forward, or you just try to squeeze yourself, and then you need to arch just to make it over the obstacle. But most of the time, I think it's, it's would, with your speed, like, it corresponds to your speed, because if you're too slow, you need to squeeze yourself in that in that direction somehow to make it and if you too fast, like there's too much energy to handle. So your hips actually actually like make it first nonetheless.

19-interviewer
So you have to kind of gauge the power you put into the vault to make sure it's the right amount for the landing you might be going for?

19-participant
Um, could you repeat that.

19-interviewer
You need to control the power you put in.

19-participant
Yeah, yeah, basically. Most of the time it's, it's something that you just teach or you learn through the way like it's it's it's almost the same thing like with precisions you know, when it when you start it's just most the time it's it's either is either too much or not enough and it's that's that gap narrows. So.

19-interviewer
So with practice you can kind of get like a good feel for what you need to do.

19-participant
Yeah.

19-interviewer
Mm. Talking about learning actually, how, how did you learn the Kong vault? Were you self taught? Did you go to classes or...?

19-participant
So yeah, I was self taught. It was kind of funny thing because I knew about some of the parkour vaults without actually doing parkour. Because we're just, we just like to chase ourselves in playgrounds and stuff like this. And we had that we had an older friend, who just told us that there is something like lazy vault or something like monkey vault we are, that was a thing for the Kong, back then, for some reason, I didn't know. And, and we just, it was something like, at the time, it was, like, something that was like, like a special skills in the in the chase game, you know, that chase tag that we played, and so everybody in the party just wanted to wanted to wanted to know that. So I would try, I mean, like, hundreds of times, through something through some walls or or anything, and but I, I would be also scared to, to make it too pull, to push that through my hands and to be straight in the motion. So I every time I just done that. I just, I just wished my my legs to decide. And it was kind of kong kind of side vault, something in between and I was just doing it because I just I just fold and hope that one time it will come and, and it just came. So that was the process. And I didn't have or know, any exercises or any other steps that could lead to that success. So I just tried.

19-interviewer
And then so how did that transition into doing it as a parkour movement? Like, did you see people doing parkour and kind of get involved? Or how did, how did that become you being a parkour coach?

19-participant
I'm not sure how much this affected my coaching. But actually, I, a lot of times I remember this, this this moment of learning Kong myself, because because I mentioned it a lot of times to the beginners that they can learn it's actually just trying to, to make it make that to make that progress from just doing a side vault and then just try to squeeze those legs, between our hands, just by pushing and trying to, trying the thing basically hundreds of times, but so they can know that it's possible, maybe it's just a motivational thing most time because, you know, it's just like, because many times if they if they cannot somehow understand. It's many times it's just about trying, you know, because sometimes you have every ingredient that you needs, but there's that element of trying if you need to, and I... what was the question again, like how did how did that affect my coaching?

19-interviewer
Yeah, I mean, so the thing I'm curious about is with coaches, whether they're teaching people the movement, the same way they learnt it, you know, or whether they've kind of updated things over time or changed them?

19-participant
So yes yeah, I definitely  updated because back then it was just simply trying so right now I'm just trying to analyse it a bit more and help them with those details. If they need it.

19-interviewer
And did that updating come about just from you thinking, I want to update this or have you learned from any other coaches or anything like that?

19-participant
There was just I don't know like just trying over and over and trying different techniques like kong to precision, double Kongs, dive Kongs and seeing other people doing them, if there was an opportunity, I would just like consult or just talk about they're views on the on them, there was not like, nothing, nothing specific. No coach or anything like that.

19-interviewer
Just kind of like social interactions just talking to people.

19-participant
Yeah.

19-interviewer
Yeah, that's, I think that's pretty common for parkour at the moment, you know, we learn from each other.

19-participant
Yeah, yeah.

19-interviewer
And kind of pass these things along. Have you seen anyone or heard of any coaching that, like, you thought was really different, or really unique, or that you thought was bad? You know, or have people generally in your experience had like, similar ways of coaching?

19-participant
I mean, it's hard to think about it most of the time. I know, it's just, from my perspective, is, it's almost every time it's, it's kind of a same thing, but actually, like, just that uniqueness of everybody's approach, like, that's the thing. So, but most of the time, it is appears to me that it is almost the same thing. But sometimes, there's a significant, significant, difference in, in the, in the system of coaching or something. Now, because it's, it's much more different when you're just outside and trying to teach somebody, just because they just asked for it. And it's different when you have a course and the people sign, and you have space and, and time for, for, for the system to create some some sort of system. Yeah.

19-interviewer
I think you mentioned quite near the start about, you know, the individual, right, you have to kind of coach to individuals, everyone's going to be slightly different. Some people are going to show up and do a kong straightaway, and some people are gonna have to train for like six months-

19-participant
Yeah, and also, and also it differs from from coach to coach, like, like that, the phrasing the wording and, because what could be a special points in, in some moves, or, for example, in that Kong, for somebody else, it would be something different, you know, those points would be maybe mixed up with a little bit, but overall, I would think that it would be kind of the same thing, or really similar.

19-interviewer
Yeah, I mean, I kind of view it as there's only so many ways you can teach that movement, right? It's, it's fairly, you know, straightforward, and you kind of need a way, you might make it like you talk about less scary, but it's still the same kind of pattern. Right?

19-participant
Yeah.

19-interviewer
Are there any, like anything when you're coaching the Kong that you're particularly looking for, and someone doing it to be able to say like, Yes, that was good or no, that was bad? As a coach?

19-participant
I mean, I just I just try to look at the performance of the one trying it and then try to decide what point is, is the most needed one to improve, so know if if the takeoff is a problem, I will try to make a point that we need to work on the most on the takeoff, or or any other path, so let's try to break it into those pieces and work on those.

19-interviewer
Are there any any of those that you kind of see a lot, like come up quite commonly for people or is it all just, everyone's individual?

19-participant
Ah, so yeah, basically, everybody's in, it is individual thing. But most of the time if if I just wants to generalise things, I would say that, that, that the take off is, is problematic. And lots of times, because that's motion that that kind of rhythm that you need to have in order to make that transition is kind of problematic for some reason. And and then that fear from falling because you stumble through the obstacle. These two things I would say.

19-interviewer
I mean, we talked about fear a little bit already, but just thinking about it again. Is it, is fear something that people have to work on with the Kong? Is that slightly unique to it as a vault? Like, I'm thinking about something like a step vault, I don't see people getting scared of the step vault, in the way that they do the Kong.

19-participant
Yeah. Yeah, definitely. There's a bit more fear in this. Yeah.

19-interviewer
I guess because of that, that commitment we talked about.

19-participant
And if I if I think about it, it's, it's kind of unique in the way because, for example, when you when you do dash vault, I would say that it is even more, like, even scarier than the Kong vault, because you just need to know you have your legs in front of you. So it's, I would say it is scary. This is definitely scarier than the Kong vault. But you can kind of fake it through the lazy vault until it is straight, but and, like the transition is kind of similar with the kong vault from the side vault, but it's not the same for some reason, like the there's this part when a person just needs to go and just do it. Yeah, there's this point that nobody ever avoids. So [laugh]

19-interviewer
I mean, comparing it still to other vaults. Is there anything like with the Kong vault that it's better at than other vaults? Or worse? Is, is there a reason you would pick a Kong vault over a dash vault, for example, or any other form? Or is it all just like, personal preference? Just what do you want to do.

19-participant
Maybe most of the time it would be preference, but I don't know it is kind of once you once you're pretty comfortable with the Kong, it's, I think it's a bit more comfortable, comfortable to do that. actually on in harder environments, like the rails and stuff like that, because you see your hands most of the time and you have a clear vision where you are going. So when you do dash vault to the rail, it is kind of scary, because you don't see the rail beneath you, so there's a kind of scary thing. And, and I don't say that it isn't scary to do, for example, dive Kongs over the rails. But you can always scale it up. So it is scary actually.

19-interviewer
Do you consider the Kong vault to be like, something important for people to learn to do parkour or useful? Or is it like a fundamental parkour movement?

19-participant
I would say so because it just gives you that just a lot of potential to work with. Because the variations are like there's a lot of them and I think it is good. In this sense. Definitely. Like a lot of potential to, to experiment and to work with. And in the sense of, like, growing as an athlete or as an parkour practitioner. It just, it almost it is almost with every move that you learn because you're more versatile, you're more universal. So it is good for you to to be more comfortable in in many different situations.

19-interviewer
I guess the flip side to that question is if someone was doing parkour and they didn't like Kongs. Is that okay, is that? Or are they missing out on something?

19-participant
Like, it's definitely okay. You don't need to do anything that you don't like, but, but the other thing is that it is not that difficult to learn, actually, and it gives you a lot of, so it gives you more in long term, even if you struggle in the beginning, so after, after you, you must say it's at least a bit, it's it gives you a lot of potential. So.

19-interviewer
I, I realised, as I was saying that it sounded like a trap question [laugh] or something like I'm trying to get you to say something bad about someone not doing something. But yeah, it's it, I guess the reason for that kind of question is, obviously, Parkour is very open. And people can do very different things and still have it be called parkour. So I'm trying, but something like the Kong feels like quite, quite like a foundational movement in parkour, kind of quite a famous, parkour move.

19-participant
Yes, yes.

19-interviewer
So I guess I'm just kind of asking people like, how did you kind of fit those two things together in terms of, parkour is open and anything you want it to be, and also we've got this set of like, very specific moves to teach you.

19-participant
Yeah, this is quite strange, strange combinations, just as you said, because it is kind of a milestone for everybody to reach that in the journey. Like, I just, I just can do a Kong vault now. But I don't know why there's that amount of traction to it. I don't think that I have an answer.

19-interviewer
I mean, I think what you said about it just being very useful is, is maybe a good reason. Yeah. You know, it's, it's survived, because people have gone yeah, I can use it for this. I can use it for that. And so it's worth learning and teaching. Is that, does that, do you agree with that? Does that sound reasonable to you?

19-participant
Yeah, I was, I would say so that by learning just a simple move, it gives you, it gives you opportunity to to have a lot of fun, or this do you need to or, you did you can grow that on to make it to another things and other variations that are a bit harder, that you can improve on that you can build on that foundation later on.

19-interviewer
So we've gone through a lot of questions, I like to try and get to people. Is there anything about the Kong vault that you'd like to know more about? Or that you're curious about? And it's okay, if the answer is no, by the way, it's, it's not to put you on the spot.

19-participant
I wouldn't like to say no, because it is like I don't know everything and not even about the kong vault. But I would like to, I would like to learn anything new about it. But I don't have anything specific. Like if you can teach me, if anybody can teach me anything new I will be really glad to learn. But I I don't have any specific I guess.

19-interviewer
Yeah, no, no problem. And is there anything else that you've maybe thought of that we didn't get a chance to talk about or popped into your head or anything else you'd like to add just at the end here?

19-participant
I don't know maybe if we talk you about that terminology or that feeling of those vaults, as you mentioned that that we see a Kong and we know it is a Kong but it's hard to explain. I sometimes I think about triple Kongs and Quadra Kongs. Because it is a silly thing. But it's sometimes it gets too much hype and and I don't know if it's Kong or it isn't because the technique is sketchy and it's something that [laugh]

19-interviewer
I mean it's strange, isn't it that these things I mean even things like dive kong and double kong. They have the word Kong in them, but are they the same movement or are they completely different? They share common things right?

19-participant
Yeah, but I would say that the dive kong and double Kong actually are Kongs, because, like, [unclear] like the dissimilarity is is really there but, but I have the problem with triple Kongs and quadra Kongs in this motion that you either do it just by tapping on the obstacles and do that Kong on the on the last one. So you basically just basically just did a dive Kong but you tap on three other obstacles, or it is just jumping in handstand, because because someone's taking it easy just to push and to make it that way.

19-interviewer
That's really interesting. I hadn't thought about it that way. You're just kicking up into a handstand-

19-participant
Someone just taps and someone is a bit stronger. So he will just jump in the handstand while still having a bit of the speed from from the run up. So.

19-interviewer
So would you consider the need to kind of have a bit of push in the arms, to be what makes something a Kong?

19-participant
I would probably say that yes. But but then when you jump in handstand, and you actually do that pushing motion, but you're in handstand and and then it is kind of I don't know that that's why I have the problem with it. So because in double Kong, it is, I think that the technique is really efficient, because you can, you can just make a lot, a lot longer distances with it. Because you if you actually if that if the technique is good, and you use your hands properly, it gives you just a more height and distance. And so it is really efficient. But with triple kongs or quadra kongs, I have this problem. And it's still unsolved that it is it is it Kong or it's not.

19-interviewer
I guess it's like, we were saying for parkour in general like it. It's, there's no rules. Basically, someone, someone could say that is a kong or triple Kong or whatever. And there's nothing that we can point to be like no, because of this or yes because of this. We just have to kind of, I guess as a community, just kind of agree?

19-participant
Yeah [laugh]

19-interviewer
That's kind of the thing I found really interesting in this kind of research is is how there are there are a lot of things that have just kind of been agreed upon, even though they're unwritten.

19-participant
Yeah. That's really interesting.

19-interviewer
But yeah, there's there's always these little, little extreme cases. Yes. Yeah, that's pretty interesting. I hadn't thought about that, that you could just go into handstand and just jump.

19-participant
Some guys do that like that.

19-interviewer
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I don't know how you'd kind of how you... I suppose momentum? Maybe? If you're just jumping with the hands.

19-participant
Yeah. Because if you would just do it straight from the handstands, it would be with you would be ridiculously strong for that just to make long jumps, in handstand and so that speed just gives you a, it just is enough force. Yeah, I guess that is still a kind of jumping just from the run up. But you, you're still jumping the handstands. And maybe with the tapping one, it's I would say that it is kind of a variation of double Kong because you do the same technique, but you just need to add just a bit more moves into the movements. So he just he...

19-interviewer
Just reached out as you go over.

19-participant
Yeah.

19-interviewer
Huh. Yeah, I kind of see what you mean that the double Kong has a very clear like takeoff and not landingexactly but like secondary part with the hands-

19-participant
Yeah, yeah, yes.

19-interviewer
Whereas in something like a triple Kong, those, those are the same. It's just there's a little bit in middle. It's whether that bit in the middle of really makes a difference. 

19-participant
Exactly. I think because in double Kong it actually helps you to make that first contact with with obstacle but then in triple Kong, it's kind of useless. It's just just to make it a bit different, to name it triple or quadruple in, but it's not effective at all. Like double kong is, I guess the peak of that efficiency.

19-interviewer
Yeah, that's really interesting. Okay, cool. Is there. Is there anything else that you'd like to add or you can think of to the throw in?

19-participant
I don't think so. I don't have anything right now.

19-interviewer
Cool. Well, I'll stop the recording in that case.
