Alright, so so the study is just really talking to parkour coaches about how they kind of understand some of the movements and how they've come to understand them, how they coach them to others, things like that. Bearing in mind that Parkour is kind of like this organically grown sport, it doesn't have like a central rulebook or, you know, group that's saying, Hey, this is what Parkour is. So it's just kind of seeing how, how these kind of different definitions of movements have kind of spread, and how people have come to understand them. And I just kind of picked the Kong vault as a particularly well known movement. But I guess the first thing to check with you is, do is the term Kong vault familiar to you? Is that the term you use, or do you use catpass, or anything else, or...?

16-participant
I just say Kong. I'll say vault to beginners who have never done parkour before. And then I'll just say Kong around, you know, my team, or other practitioners that I meet up with. So what was that other word? You just said just now?

16-interviewer
Oh, catpass?

16-participant
Oh, catpass. Yeah, I forgot that was a term for it. That mostly covers like high gaps, right?

16-interviewer
I mean, I use them pretty much interchangeably. Some people have told me that they have said they use them for different things. Or even like Kong, and monkey, as two different things.

16-participant
Oh, wow. I forgot about monkey too.

16-interviewer
Yeah. Do you just use kind of Kong to cover all those things?

16-participant
Yeah. And various labels. I just, I forgot that monkey was a was a term for the same move too. So that's always interesting. Is that more, do you find that like, depending on the country, or the exact community, specifically?

16-interviewer
A bit of both? It's, it seems like it's a little bit more likely in some countries than others. So from my experience talking so far, it coaches from the US they seem to use Kong quite a bit. But it seems pretty, pretty random. And it just seems to be you know, like you say, the community that someone's learned parkour in just whatever words they happen to use, they might have picked up from they've watched a particular parkour video, or, you know, went to a particular class and it's just kind of what people are used to mostly.

16-participant
There's a lot of tutorials out there. Yeah. So.

16-interviewer
Um, so I guess a good place to start is, how would you describe the Kong?

16-participant
I would describe it... So some I've found that some people confuse it with the bear walk the natural movement beginners like PE class term bear walk. But I've noticed that the bear walk is you know, more tilting straight kneed. And more opposite limbs working together where whereas the Kong is more like hands, feet, hands, feet, hands feet with this rhythm to it. So yeah, I can see why it's also called monkey because you are moving around like a like an ape or chimpanzee. So that's how I describe it just moving on all four limbs.

16-interviewer
Is that you know, when you think about comparing it to the bear crawl, do you mean on the floor?

16-participant
Yes.

16-interviewer
And so that kind of hands feet movement... Is that used elsewhere as well? So like we talked about it being a vault a little bit as well, is it used on obstacles?

16-participant
When I'm specifically doing a kong on an obstacle?

16-interviewer
Yeah.

16-participant
Yeah, if I if I feel like I'm going straight on toward an obstacle to vault or Kong it, I definitely emphasise when teaching QM and then Kongs like hands than feet. Because the timing between those two different parts of the upper and lower body are crucial for a safe, controlled landing that I've noticed when teaching people. Very occasionally I'll see like, the advanced parkour athletes, when they're maybe going across an obstacle that's more like a corner like two adjacent walls meeting, they'll kind of do this funny thing where they stagger the timing of both hands versus both at the same time. So I rarely see that. And that really depends on what they want to do and where they want to go. But that's advanced, if I taught that to beginners, it would just, I feel like confuse them with the mechanics of learning. Right? I'll put my phone away, keeps vibrating.

16-interviewer
So what would you say, like, it's kind of difficult to say like a normal Kong, because obviously, there's a lot of variation you can do. But a usual thing is to have both hands at the same time?

16-participant
That's what I've actually noticed. Watching videos of all kinds of athletes of all levels.

16-interviewer
I wonder if you could give me some more detail about using it as a vault, then like, what kind of things is it used on? Or, how would you kind of give a bit more detail about describing the movement?

16-participant
Um, okay. Are you asking like, progressions? What the progressions would be, or...?

16-interviewer
Yeah, I mean, we could talk about that. It's, as I say, the study is just kind of trying to understand how people know the movement. So if you are watching someone, and they did a movement, you go, Oh, yeah, they just did a Kong. How do you kind of know that that's what they did? Again, saying, like, you know, there's no rulebook for parkour. So just kind of how people have come to go, that is a column that is a dash that is a lazy,  right, that kind of what are the features of that? I mean, it's quite a broad question.

16-participant
I was just waiting for you finish I didn't want to interrupt. So since you mentioned, like two different movements, let's just say, to tell the difference between a Kong and a dash, which are both clearing an obstacle in a similar way, Kong, you're leading with the hands touching first, then feet follow. Dash is similar, because you're still jumping over, but your feet lead. And then your hands fall like briefly, as briefly as you would upon. That's how I differentiate between the two moves.

16-interviewer
So the hands going first is kind of a defining feature of the Kong.

16-participant
Yeah. Yeah, but the with a feet, I mean, with a dash, you're almost treating it like this, like super leaned back precision jump. That's how I see it with the dash. So you're almost simply jumping over the obstacle, you don't really have to like emphasise the hands, the hands are just there, to reassure that your body doesn't graze the wall. And it helps like transition, much smoother landing, because, do a dash but don't do it like perfectly and it will feel kind of kind of bumpy and weird like that, like being buffed. So that's how I see a dash and a kong.

16-interviewer
How about, you know, if you're going to really break it down for someone, perhaps if you're coaching, are there particular ways that people would take off for the movement? Or land for the movement? How would you break those down?

16-participant
I've a whole page, one page of my progressions, I cannot wait to share this. So for progressions for the Kong, definitely, definitely learn how to roll. Because if you come out of that badly, especially since you're going face first in a kong that could be nasty on your wrists, on your face, maybe awful belly flop or an awful like shoulder ram landing on your side. So obviously, I'm not gonna go into rolls because that's not what we're talking about. But learn rolls first in order to bail out of a Kong. And then when it comes to learning the Kong always starting on the ground with I'm sure what you've heard QMs or quadrupedal movement. Is that how you pronounce it? So with the QM, when I'm teaching kids because it's so hard for them to grasp because they want to frog hop, and that's more of an upward motion, and they're bouncing. Whereas this feels more like controlled stepping hands first, then feet. So what, um, I'll like use those floor ladder or ladders that you can just like, throw out on the floor in PE class, and that's a really good way to control and give them rhythm and a give them a target for every time they're placing down their hands and feet. And I just say okay, without jumping up, and without kicking behind you. I want you to show me flat fingers. And just hands, feet, hands, feet. I'll have their hands land in the next square and I'll let their feet land in the square behind. But realistically, and ideally, I try to get them to put hands and feet in the same square of each of the ladder. And but even before I teach that, I teach them stationarity QMs, which is a good warm up, not a lot of strain on the body. And it's teaching them balance and core and coordination, and timing. So like, so just imagine being stationary, and you're on your hands and knees, and you lift up one hand and then the opposite leg. And that just teaches them the difference between both sides of the body and the upper and the lower body. And then when I once I know they have control and coordination, then I teach them the coordination of hands and feet, hands and feet. But I don't always teach the stationary balancing because sometimes I just look at my kids, and I go, yeah, they'll, they'll get it, we'll just go right into their hands feet, hands feet. So I've noticed from a bunch of tutorials that I've seen in the past, people teach similarly, like the floor Kong were you doing the hands, feet, hands, feet, but your hips are higher, so your butt's higher, you're trying to extend out farther and farther, to do even give yourself an imaginary line or target to reach to to extend your QM or your floor Kong, whatever you want to call it. And the idea is to learn how to basically pull your feet to your hands, or how long or how far you can reach and how much faster you can do it. You can start with your butt low like my kids will start with their butts low and their hands landing right in front of their feet, just so that they're really understanding the full movement. And then I will encourage them to lift their hips high their butts high for so they can start bringing their chests up and keeping their chests up for the later stages of the Kong. I've noticed some people teach staggering donkey kicks on the floor with the Kong. Um, so same thing, but high, but you start kicking one foot out than the other. And then you can see how high you can kick for those like advanced double Kongs. And some people try to see if they can land a Kong from a handstand, which I thought was kind of cool. I don't know how many parkour athletes you follow on social media, if at all, but I just saw [name], I don't know his last name. But [name] in the parkour community, he's known for climbing and doing Ninja Warrior obstacle courses. He was able to do like a handstand on top of this high ledge, and then just just snap his feet down to the next ledge down below. And like he's full on like vertical handstand mode. That's scary. Amazing perfect technique right there. Some people have done it from a push up, see, they're gonna push up and then snap their feet and stand up. And it's all about seeing how far your feet can land ahead of your hands. So that is my step one out of, step three.

16-interviewer
Before you move on in that case, can I just ask you a couple of questions about that. I made a few notes about things. So that one of the early things you said was about getting the fingers flat? Is that something that you've seen, you know, people have a tendency to steeple the fingers or things like that, is it, it's important to get it flat?

16-participant
For, on cement, I mean, when we're on the gym floor, it's not a big deal, but I try to break the habit right away. Because I'll see even adults like do the Tarzan knuckles. I'll see people lift their hands up and I'm like, you'll hurt your wrist. So I just try to get rid of the habit right away, though. You know, the kids want to be Tarzan. Sure.

16-interviewer
Is it like a safety thing? It's safer to be flat hand or is it a technique thing? Or both?

16-participant
Oh, yeah. You don't want to people might just like suddenly put too much weight over maybe one shoulder or one hand and go. And I could just imagine like, eeh, that's them. Or, you know, just strain on the wrist. And I do try to start with warm ups. Like right away, like as we're jogging, I'll have a shake our wrist one of them up for, for kongs, because that's a lot, on your wrist.

16-interviewer
Do kongs in general put strain through the wrist, do you think?

16-participant
Yep, through the wrist and then like through the shoulders, if you've never done anything like that in your life, it will be sore. Even this day, like if I've gone a good month without having done a Kong or a good week. I'll be a little sore, I'll feel it in those areas.

16-interviewer
And the the idea of kind of getting the feet up to the hands, or even past the hands. Is that... are they just, do the hands stay on the floor and the feet just come through? Or is there some kind of like lifting as well to create space as the knees come up to the chest? [overlap] I'm sorry.

16-participant
Repeat your question.

16-interviewer
So I'm just curious with, you know, when you say you're getting the feet up to the hands, are the hands just staying on the floor? Or are you trying to push off or anything like that?

16-participant
For so with the kids, because there's a lot for them to think about if you give them too many directions for something so complex. I just tell them like everyone just step, like treat the movement like stepping so stepping hand stepping feet stepping has nothing crazy, no kicking, no like boom, smack. But if we weren't further along than I would start emphasising the sliding or pulling. When I'm teaching the average teenager or 20 year old something person, I will start emphasising the sliding of hands because when I'm when I'm watching or doing the vault, the kong, there's a moment where it feels like you're slapping or it's like kind of like slamming your hands. But it's very brief, it immediately becomes a slide and then what feels like a pull.

16-interviewer
So the hands are pulling back to kind of throw yourself forward a a bit?

16-participant
Mmhmm.

16-interviewer
Okay.

16-participant
Yeah. So great way to force your feet forward. And to, yes, yeah.

16-interviewer
Okay. All right. Cool. So what was the next progression?

16-participant
Um, moving it to a low curb, sidewalk, or even those like parking things that cars park at in each space slot. So you just bring it to the curb, and I've noticed some people for the sake of control and slow practice, like they'll cup their feet, their thumbs around the curb, in case they need to like catch themselves. But as you keep practising Kong going on to the curb, I would keep thumbs away from the edge so you don't like jam them. Or end up slipping. It's kind, yeah, it's this weird like in between, like, you don't want to be too far out flat on the curb. You don't want to your heels, the heels of your palms being too close to the curb either. I mean, if you have great control, then it doesn't really matter. But just practising, either the staggered donkey kicks on to the curb, or maybe standing a few feet away and diving toward the curb. But the idea is to just bring it a little higher and higher each time. Yep, don't smash your, your toes or your shins or your face.

16-interviewer
Always pretty good advice. Yeah.

16-participant
That's pretty much it for that for step two.

16-interviewer
Okay, so just adding a little bit of height to get up on top. Okay, what comes next, in that case?

16-participant
Um, higher ledge, so about waist high. And I would practice, I would practice mounting it by craning it so just standing in front of it and using your hands to push up and get one foot on and practise that a few times and then I mean some people might be nervous and keep their hands down on the ledge but if they're confident enough, practice with the hands balance in front of you. And then um then maybe even like start practising with two feet, mount on it with two feet and then start backing up a bit and adding a more of a run toward it. I would never have anyone start like charging at it full on, we all have the beginners, a lot of freaking out or just slamming right into it. And then, when they do start mastering mounting with both feet on, I try to really emphasise knees in between the elbows, knees tucked to the chest. And they can start landing like a spider, Spider Man kind of way, like just kind of like they're crouching, kneeling, no, not kneeling, crouching, with your knees between your hands, hands on the ledge, and you're kind of leaning over. It'd be more ideal if this ledge was wider, so they're not afraid of falling over on down to the ground. But if they're confident, then it can be a little skinnier. And I find that slight shift in difference. And the width of the curb can really affect someone's mentality as they approach this. And then of course, you really want them to focus on the upward motion, and not leaning forward as much, but more on the upward motion. And then you just start practising, diving more toward it. And then the whole, like, how far can you get your feet past your hands, and they can, if it's a wider ledge, they can start practising konging, almost as if they're going to clear it without their feet touching, but their feet can still kind of like, land on the ledge. And then they hop off quickly on the other side. And then just keep landing their feet closer and closer to the other edge until they feel confident to clear it without feet touching. And then, very importantly, keeping that chest up, which is why I like to emphasise chest to the knees. No, that doesn't make sense, chest up because, chest up because you want to land out of it standing upright and running out of it. I still do this to this day, I'll still when I'm not really warmed up, Kong and lean over too much. And land funny, I won't fall or break my face, but it will just look so sloppy, because my chest is too forward. So just really emphasising keeping yourself safe. So you're landing in it in a nice, smooth run transitioning out of it. And then when it comes to like approaching it, because the approach really makes a difference in the success of the vault. Like first I'll have them standing in front of it. So they're not charging at it. And then when I feel like they're in control, clearing it, then I challenge them to start running lightly toward it. And vaulting and then I'll have them like really think about striding toward it. So that when they take off, they're only taking off a one foot instead of two, two makes the clearing of the obstacle kind of awkward. Stride really helps get a nice smooth arch. Some people will just habitually brake, you know, having jumped before the actual jump. And we all know how that looks

16-interviewer
A little hop, hop to two feet. And then go. Yeah.

16-participant
Yeah, and it just ruins all that momentum that you're getting from that nice stride into the vault. So I really try to tell people stagger your launch do not jump off of two, it kills your momentum. And I kind of treat it like a plane going off, except planes can't dip, but like. So you're going straight up first and you adding this little dip and that's when your arms are going back for that hurl at that little dip so that it becomes this nice upward momentum. Some people just try to go straight and go, ee, that's just not consistent, doesn't feel good. You'll feel the difference once you understand that dip and apply it.

16-interviewer
So all these things are to kind of help keep the momentum from your run into the vault?

16-participant
And just makes it even easier to not to not just do the vault and succeed but run out as smoothly or transition into some other move. And if they have already, if they already know how to do a precision jump, I try to tell them like land as if you were about to do a precision landing, like there's a curve on the inside and you got land perfectly. Chest up. Two feet on or one foot in case you want to, I don't know, step off that curve, something like that. And those are my progressions to a kong.

16-interviewer
How, um. I really like that you've described it as like an an arc over the obstacle. And that idea of maintaining momentum. Is that like an important component of the vault to make it a successful, kong vault, to like keep a consistent momentum throughout?

16-participant
I, personally, yeah, that's something I've noticed when I started learning how to kong. It took such a long time for me to learn it. And then someone one day said, Oh, just add this little dip. And I was like, Oh, that makes sense. Like, you're turning downward momentum into upward momentum, versus trying to, I don't know, trying to interrupt this nice flow. I don't know. I definitely noticed the difference when I was a beginner.

16-interviewer
How, um, how did you learn the vault? Did you teach yourself or did you go to classes or anything like that?

16-participant
Definitely learned it from someone. So I was in art school, in Florida. And by junior year, I, the our professor was like, here's your assignment, go experience something new, do an art project about it. And I always already, like, parkour. So I located very fast, a local Facebook group that does parkour. And I met up with their leader [name], who founded the [name]. And he let me take photo video references of him doing some wall runs, tic-tacs, whatever. And then when we finished, he was like, do you want to try? And I was like, Yes, I like, already had my shoes ready. I was hoping for him to ask that. So yeah, he taught me right there in that park. And, and then I went to some open gyms. And then I started taking private lessons from him. And then on Sundays, they would go to the beach, where there are all these picnic tables and trees, to practice all of our basic movement. So and then from there, I like, slowly start teaching myself. But it's always it's always like a combo of everything, your community, online tutorials, classes, private, tutoring, and self taught. So.

16-interviewer
Do you think you learnt in a way similar to the progressions you now used to teach others? Or is that something that you've come up with yourself since you've learned?

16-participant
I think since I've learned, I've come up with, because I'm always just like looking stuff online. So I think I learned more from now online than I have from when I was with people. Because [name] has like, a nearly non existent parkour community. I have my small team here. And I'm not always training with them. So it's really hard to just be merely part of that community. To inspire you to push yourself, like, the past two years, I was like doing really well doing all these solo trainings, and meeting up with my team maybe once or twice a week. But currently, it's been kind of hard to get back into it. Also I am recovering from my obsession with snowboarding. I've been doing nothing but snowboarding so I've not parkoured at all. All winter. So I feel like that's really thrown me out of the game. And I'm just watching all my friends, all my my teammates, just like excelling. And I'm like, ah, snowboarding is so fun.

16-interviewer
Well, you know, I suppose that's the thing. They might be excelling, but can they snowboard? That's the question.

16-participant
Yes, they can! [laugh]

16-interviewer
Oh [laugh]

16-participant
One of them is our best one [name]. He can snowboard and do tricks and parkour like he is fire. But that's just him like, [unclear] can snowboard. But and he can parkour but he can't do though. Like [name] can.

16-interviewer
Right. So just to go back a tiny bit. You mentioned about learning from online stuff. Is that just watching videos of other people moving or is it like actual coaching resource stuff?

16-participant
I just, just movements and you know everyone likes to throw their own tutorial videos out there so it can be just some dude I've never heard of. And I'll just watch it curiously, like, I'm always curious of how people teach parkour. And I think it's really fun. Because I can either be like, Wow, that's really a shitty way to teach it. Or I can be like, wow, that's I would love, I can't wait to like, try that and then teach it. Because it does seem helpful and slightly slightly different approach, or at least a missing component that that you can add to what you've already been teaching. So.

16-interviewer
Is there anything like relating to the Kong vault that you particularly remember thinking, Oh, that was a really good tip, or whatever. You picked up somewhere? Or, I guess my question really is, have you have you seen some people teach the Kong vault in really different ways? Or does everyone kind of do it in a similar way with like, little differences?

16-participant
I would say there is someone I watched, taught similar to everyone else. But then he added all these like tiny little missing components that was like, oh, like that just filled in the gap between these two existing progressions I've seen everyone else teach. That was cool. To add even more to what I know. I can't say I've watched a lot of Kong tutorials. Because the stubborn ego in me saying oh, you know that let's find a tutorial to something you haven't really, a weakness that you have not addressed in yourself in your parkour. So sometimes I find my mind wandering to other tutorials. So haven't seen enough kong tutorials a lot. I mean, but enough.

16-interviewer
I'm curious as well, because you let me just double check. But I believe you said you... yeah, you have some coaching qualifications as well. Right? Yeah. From WFPF. Did they teach you anything about coaching the kong vault? Or was that, were those courses more about like, general coaching guidance, rather than like parkour specific skill coaching?

16-participant
A bit of both.

16-interviewer
Okay.

16-participant
So I went, I forgot all about my certification. Like I've been doing this for long, I'm actually certified. I'm only certified in levels one and two. But I got certified years ago, at the [name] gymnastics gym. And yeah, I took an actual coaching class for a whole weekend. It was like non stop. It was like, from eight in the morning to like, four, like, maybe like a brief lunch break. But like, everyone was just so energetic, and so invested, like, time flew by so fast. And like, I mean, you were playing, and parkouring as you were learning, so Oh, I need to do that again. That was so fun. But yeah, they taught us progressions that I would never ever, ever thought of what I had started parkour, because I only had done it a little bit before I took that class. So it was a it was a big eye opener. And maybe it was a while ago, so I don't remember a lot of the content. I just remember being like, yeah, they know their shit.

16-interviewer
But it didn't necessarily, you don't necessarily teach the Kong vault now, you know exactly how you learnt to teach it in that certification course. You still have your own... You don't remember?

16-participant
It was so long ago. Like, 3, 4, 3 or 4 years ago? That's a long time [laugh]

16-interviewer
Fair enough. Yeah. I'm just, as I say, because I'm curious about how people learn and then pass on the movements. Particularly with quite an open sport, like parkour you could be teaching anything, but we do have these kind of parkour movements, you know. I mean, I guess I should check that with you, dude. Do you consider the Kong vault like a parkour technique? Or is it just...?

16-participant
Yeah, I would say so. I don't think I've seen, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, in fact, like, even people know little about parkour, but they know what it is simply from having seen glimpses of it on media. Like when I'm doing a kong out there, someone knows. Someone shouts you know, parkour outside and you're just like, yeah.

16-interviewer
It's it's kind of a bit of a famous move right? Like, it's because it's it's just different enough that people can recognise it. Whereas if you're doing like a step vault, they might just be oh, they're just climbing over a fence [laugh] Like, it's, it's quite distinct.

16-participant
I think you're right. It's a good point. Um... I was gonna say something to that. Yes, it's so funny. When you really think back to when parkour first became known. It was like, such a crazy move, like out of this world move to see. And now it's just like a basic. Like, that's how much parkour has evolved. It's crazy.

16-interviewer
I'm just gonna, I was actually gonna ask about that, because you use the word basic to describe it earlier. Do you consider it like, a fundamental movement? Something that people should learn in parkour? Is it like, an important part of your parkour toolkit?

16-participant
It's not necessary. Like you can still step vault. But it is efficient. So it's kind of beneficiary, beneficiary, it benefits you. Yeah.

16-interviewer
Yeah, I mean, that's always the trouble isn't that there's always an option. You could always do something else. Is there, is there anything that maybe the Kong vault is particularly good for? Or like, unique, maybe in parkour? LIke you go, Oh, that's something that a Kong vault is really useful for?

16-participant
Definitely the fastest way to drop down from something. If you're like, yeah, I'm not afraid of heights. I don't have time to like climb over this fence. Why not just Kong it to this big drop, and roll out of it? Like that is, probably the fastest way you get out there if you had to. Um, I think it'd be handy for high gaps, so I can picture someone, maybe trying to stand there and being like, yeah, I want to pre that. But that seems like I don't know. Maybe they'll be like, that's too high to pre. So maybe I'll just kong it. You know what I mean.

16-interviewer
So like, kind of, if you were standing on top of something, it'd be quite a drop to jump down. But if you're just konging, if you doing a vault, you're not dropping quite as far, is that what you mean?

16-participant
Oh, I meant, like, let's say the ledge is just like too high. So here's you. And here's the ledge, like you see, maybe like...

16-interviewer
Oh, I see. So instead of jumping up onto it, you kong.

16-participant
Okay. Yeah. You could kong to it and cat it, or you just run and plyo or stride. And then cat it. I don't know [unclear]

16-interviewer
Yeah, it's, you know, it's fine to say that no, that it's there's always an option in parkour. It's one of the things I'm interested in what the study is, you know, we have these kind of techniques with names. The, if you're considering something like gymnastics, they're kind of defined because they have to be judged. You know, someone has to give them a score. We don't we don't have that. So, you know, what, what is being passed along in coaching? How do we define our movements in parkour? Which is a very big question. And that's kind of the reason why I'm asking a whole bunch of people about it. Just to see what their opinion is.

16-participant
What is their opinion? I'm kind of curious to hear what you've heard from other practitioners.

16-interviewer
Well, I mean, I shouldn't really tell you, I don't want to like lead your answers. Okay. I'm curious. After I can, I can tell you that about what I've hard so far, sure. No problem. But I'd be curious what your kind of opinion on something like that might be.

16-participant
What was the question again?

16-interviewer
Yeah, just kind of how we, how we know what the movements in parkour even are and how we pass those along. Considering people could just go Yeah, I don't really like kongs so I'm never going to do them again. And yet they've survived. You know?

16-participant
That's an interesting question. Yeah.

16-interviewer
It's turned a little bit philosophical, which I didn't intend. But...

16-participant
And like you said, parkour has evolved. So like a Kong can suddenly become a dive kong. You know, or are you going to do a corkscrew, a 360 or whatever like...

16-interviewer
I mean, you said earlier, you know, it started out and it was like, Wow, look at that thing. And now it's something you might do in your first class, you know?

16-participant
Absolutely, exactly. This is too philosophical [laugh]

16-interviewer
It's okay. If if it's not something that an answer particularly springs to mind, it's no big deal. Just kind of seeing what people think. But it's curious to me that you have these progressions for a kong and quite, seems like quite a clear idea of what Kong is. But also, you said it's not necessarily so I'm like...

16-participant
Or maybe it is, I don't know, because I, you know, I now that we're talking about it, like ideas are coming to my mind. And no, I think of how you know, it's to clear an obstacle, right without touching it really spending any time on it. But you don't have to run around it or under it. But then you think about moves like the speed vault. Speed vault clears it just as fast. I think with the speed vault, though, not everyone can speed vault over a very wide obstacle. Unless they Kong it, which is funny how that works, like a kong can clear an obstacle more than a speed vault. But then you see athletes like I don't know if you heard of [name]? I don't know if I'm pronouncing his name, right.

16-interviewer
Yes, yeah. London? I believe so. Yeah.

16-participant
Like he, he may have been the athlete, or one of the first athletes to, what's, maybe, is it the speed vault, or is it more of a step vault, like basically, being able to step vault or speed vault over three different obstacles consecutively. And it's crazy, because like, that's so unnecessary. But, you know, it looks like someone challenged themselves to me, like, let's like, push the most basic vault, the one that existed before the Kong, and see if we can carry it over all these obstacles, and they did it. Step vault over three or four walls just like slowly, like about at that length, or the height? Yeah, they're just like three walls in a row going a little lower and lower each time. And they maybe not as fast, but it was pretty fast. Never touched the ground. So. Food for thought.

16-interviewer
I wonder if it's, you know, when you consider something like that, that's quite an advanced thing. That's not something that every everyone's going to be able to do. So maybe it's a case of like, the Kong lets people do that kind of stuff. But for like, you know, the majority of people. It's kind of not everyone's gonna be able to do that really advanced stuff with the speed vault or the step vault, but they might with a Kong vault. So it's like kind of serving a function that way. It's easier to do some of the things that are difficult to do with other vaults. I think that made sense [laugh]

16-participant
Wait are trying to say they couldn't have done that without learning this?

16-interviewer
No, er. It doesn't matter. I mean, I guess the the real question is just, you know, what is the utility of the Kong? What, what what makes it something that people use if it's not strictly necessary? Why would someone choose to do it?

16-participant
Maybe... Maybe it's just considered a very smooth transitional move to a different move. You know like Kong pre, kong cat hang, Kong climb up, Kong stride, like maybe it's just...

16-interviewer
Just gives you a bunch of options on the other side.

16-participant
Yeah, Kong roll, kong drop. It's funny because like, it doesn't always have to be the first move to a string of movements. It could be like the last move. You could have like stride Kong or roll Kong or plyo kong.

16-interviewer
So maybe it's just quite easy to connect it with other movements.

16-participant
Yeah. That's where this conversation has gone.

16-interviewer
Can you think of any reason why that might be the case?

16-participant
Why it connects movements?

16-interviewer
Yeah, why might it be easy to connect it to other movements?

16-participant
It just is... just a movement. You know, it's funny how parkour movement lovers and philosophers would say Parkour is primitive natural movement. And yet, it's so hard for a majority of people to learn. And that's natural and instinctual. And that, but that just comes from being part of a modern society where we're sitting all the time. And we're like, relying on other equipment and other sports for entertainment. When parkour in itself can be really entertaining. If you know the basics to give yourself the the creativity and freedom to explore whatever available space you have around you. And that's hard. Some people, I may teach them these movements, but they don't know how to look at an environment and parkour out of it, you know, like, they don't know what to do with it. That's... So I think with the Kong, same thing. What is it? What will you make of it? How will you make it necessary and functional?

16-interviewer
Yeah, I'm curious about that description of it as like a natural movement. But I think right at the start, you described how sometimes people can freak out when they're learning it. Is it, is it like a natural, instinctive movement for us? You know, it might be for monkeys and cats? You know, that we've named it for, but. Is it natural for us? Do you think? Or do we have to learn how to do it?

16-participant
The kong, specifically, just that move in itself among all basic movement, "basic". Maybe it's not. Parkour in its essence, is natural. But the Kong? I'm glad you know, this. It's crazy. It's crazy. Like I when I first saw your message on that Facebook group, saying, like, I'm gonna study the kong. And I'm like, that's an interesting move of all moves to study. But now that we're talking about it, I'm like, you're right. There's a lot I'd like to know, that needs to be addressed.

16-interviewer
I mean, you could do it for any movement. It's just, I think, you know, because that the Kong is that slightly famous one. And there's not a lot of scientific research into, into it, I was like, that's a good place to start. But you could apply it to any movement, like, what is it used for? How have we learnt it? How do we pass it along? Really, are kind of the three main things I'm interested in. And what's been interesting to talk to people about the Kong is, it does seem like a movement that has developed. That is like a parkour movement, like people teach it and learn it to do parkour with and not anything else. Whereas someone just running for a bus might do a step vault or without really knowing that it's a step vault. They're really unlikely to just do a kong spontaneously without being taught the movement.

16-participant
That's a good point.

16-interviewer
Would you agree?

16-participant
Yeah, they do step vault or speed vault, or they just awkwardly hurdle it like track and field. All very good points. I don't know what else to extend on that.

16-interviewer
Fair enough. I mean, I'm, you know, do you have any questions yourself about the movement? Is there anything that as a coach or as a practitioner, you're like, I don't know about this, or I don't know about that. Or that you're curious about?

16-participant
Just how I could teach it better. So it's always like, enlightening to talk about parkour like this. Because you just end up thinking about things you don't think about before. Or someone shares with you something that was the missing link to your coaching, especially with kids because I mainly work with kids. Like I definitely would not be teaching kids Kongs as I'm teaching like four to seven year, or six months or seven year olds, and it's just too complex for them to understand like, they're coordinations already all over the place, it's too dangerous to teach them the Kong. But like, if the class was called, learn how to do the Kong, then maybe Yeah, but there's all these other moves, I had to like, teach them in an hour class, in a one hour class that I have to cover. And, you know, with kids, it's different, the aim is different. It's not so much teaching the skill as it is to keep their attention. So like, it would be cool to learn more ways on how to teach it better. So that it keeps their interests and and even with adults. Yeah.

16-interviewer
I mean, it's curious to me because you have, you know, these progressions that you talked about, and you clearly think about the movement and coaching as you say about learning some things to teach it better. Do you think you need to be better at coaching? Is your method working? Do you find it works for people? If it works, do you need to change?

16-participant
I wouldn't say change it, just keep adding to it. Because you know, sometimes with each individual, they don't need every single detailed step. You can just like move on to the next one. When you when you read their movement and go like oh, they're pretty self aware of their body. They have bodily kinesthetic intelligence. Yeah, I wouldn't say change. But it does help me that I should, now that I've said all this, I'd like I definitely need to practice the Kong a lot more now. Talking about this, I'm like, I really need to practice my Kongs, because I apply it quite a bit. And I can I'm like getting to that point where I can do a Kong pre but I can't do it consistently perfectly without fear. Like I always have to warm up to it. Like so to me in my mind. That is me. That's me trying to master it like I'm not a master at all of Kongs or parkour in general. When I have to keep warming up to it and like mentally prep myself like and then you see athletes out there who don't have to like prep at all but just say yeah, I'm just gonna do this.

16-interviewer
What is that fear that you feel for the movement? What do you have to warm up to?

16-participant
I have to warm up mostly on... what I mean warm up, a bit of its mental, a bit of its physical for me, physical I have to warm up, on loosening up. I find my body tensing a lot when I'm doing a kong no matter how many years I've been doing Kongs and, and parkour in general, I tell myself if it feels easy and if you're looking at it and thinking easy, it will be easy. If you find yourself, your body tensing up. And the way your kong feel is heavy and not light you know that you could do better or that maybe you can improve your mindset and your prepping. So whenever I land a really beautiful Kong pre in the gym, it's because like, I was loosened up, I was mentally prepping myself and I warmed up to it, but also like, I don't know, I guess parkour really isn't that hard. And yet it is. Like, I can do a Kong. But I can't do it perfectly. So that's what's hard about it. But I found that, like I said, I'm like ranting all over the place, I found that when I do a perfect kong pre my mind was clear. And my body felt light, it didn't feel heavy mid flight. Mid flight is where I know whether or not I'm like, going to do something, right. You ever feel that feeling when you're doing a nice pre, especially the high one or a super far one? Like, you know, you've you know, something's up when it feels heavy. Like there's heaviness in your feet, your your torso, your mind, whatever. So, and then whatever. Like you, you got to make sure you land right you know, so there's the technique to that like prepping up to that to make sure the kong pre is safe.

16-interviewer
I wonder if that feeling is related back to that, like arc and the momentum stuff we were talking about earlier? Where if you get that nice and smooth, that's maybe when that feeling comes about.

16-participant
Yeah, that's, that's a good connection there. Same with that same with just the basic Kong without any follow ups. Like, if I feel like I'm charging at it rather than dipping, I know there's a difference. Like, I know the difference. I know what's the right way and the wrong way, at least for me.

16-interviewer
Is that more of a physical or mental thing? In your experience. Like, when you say warming up, you're warming up because you're worried about it or do you literally mean physically warming up, like for exercise?

16-participant
Well it links, right? Like physical can't happen without mental but sometimes, sometimes you find yourself not thinking about it. And the physical is doing all the work. But that's I don't know. You know what I mean, yeah. And I don't know, maybe on a bad training day, you're just like, kind of like walking around staring around at things and you're like, not feeling it. And sometimes that's just all in the head. Or maybe it's the move, maybe you're like, Okay, today's not a day day for kongs. Today is a day of pres or just simple balance. I'd say 90% is mental.

16-interviewer
Is the Kong like, how can I put this this... you know, just just made me think of this, when he said about some days, you know, you might not be feeling a certain technique. Is the Kong like, a little bit more of a challenging, vault compared to say, like a step vault, which is fairly kind of, kind of easy. You know, there's an element of effort required for a kong, I would say, do you think that's fair?

16-participant
It's exhausting. I'm like, always kind of breathing a bit after, you know, drilling it a few times for a line or even... Yeah, there's always effort for sure. In the Kong versus the step vault.

16-interviewer
I guess the thing you made me think of it is like, if I wasn't feeling great, for whatever reason, and I want to have just like a nice light training session, I'd go out and do step vaults, and maybe lazy vaults, no problem without thinking about it. But I probably wouldn't do Kong vault in like a light, gentle session. I don't know if you, is that, does that's like, is that something...

16-participant
Are you saying thats you personally or are you saying...?

16-interviewer
Yeah, it's, it's, it's just what I kind of feel like I've noticed, and maybe I might have seen in some other people, if I kind of think about it, but I can't say for sure. I don't know, is that anything you would find? Or?

16-participant
Definitely, I mean, if it's just a simple Kong, where there's like, not a drop behind it, or at least a big drop or like, a target behind it. I'll do it on a on a tired day. I probably wouldn't do with a lot of effort. You know, I mean, because I know, there's not the effort, because I know I'm tired. I know there may be risks of me hurting myself, because that's how athletes hurt themselves, they're either, they're either, they're, they're lazy, because they know they can do it. Because they've done 1000 times and they don't think about it. They're not like in the moment, and they're prone to injury, or it's the extreme opposite. They're doing something they've never done before. But they're pushing themselves and they get hurt. So that's how I see it. Like, if I'm tired, I'm not gonna be thinking about a lot even though I've done this move a million times, I'm gonna get hurt. I might as well just stay away from it.

16-interviewer
And I'm aware of the time we've been talking for about an hour now. I don't want to take up too much your day. And also I have to transcribe this so I try and keep them to about an hour so that I'm not transcribing the whole day. Is there anything else before we kind of wrap up that has popped in your head that we didn't get to or you want to just throw in at the end?

16-participant
Just I guess a conclusive comment would be like I just wish there was more parkour in my area. More like outdoor or indoor Parkour gyms, and like a more supportive school curriculum for parkour, because like I hear places like in the UK have schools where the curriculum includes parkour, and have like parkour gyms attached to their schools. I think that's like was at Denver? No, not Denver. What am I talking about? Starts with a D from the UK and I'm totally blanking out. Um, yeah, just I don't know, maybe I have to move. Just wishing there is more, more passion for it. Because I'm not even just passionate. It's like, more curiosity. Because like, I can be parkouring and people around me witnessing it or like parkour, Oh, man, I've always wanted to try and I'll be like, Oh, you want to try? They'll be like, No, I don't like that it's definitely a niche for a reason, like, very handful of people who started with me actually continue training it. And I find that sad and beautiful about the sport. It's beautiful, because it is a gem in the sand kind of sport. But at the same time, it's like, only they could feel what I feel where I feel the need to train it daily. Instead of just trying at once and then being like Yeah, I'm good. And I see that a lot. And it's disheartening, especially among the female community. Currently, I am trying to start a woman warrior class with my ninja warrior friend. And we're both pretty much the only most athletic people I know. At least in that realm of niche sports. I know one other like parkour girl, but she does more flips and stuff. And she's good. She can like do backflips off of a tree, cartwheels, and all these other moves that I don't know the names to, because that's just not my thing. Like, people being Parkour is and it can be, but that's not what I think Parkour is, which is fine, they can be different. But she can't like do a simple precision, and she can't climb up on rooftops. So like, you know, I mean, like, it's just, it's really just trying to find a few females interested. But it never goes beyond that. It doesn't become a daily discipline for them.

16-interviewer
Do you have any, like thoughts on why that might be?

16-participant
I did a woman survey. Like, I might post it again, just to see if I can get more participants by released it on my Instagram. And I asked questions like, I have it right here. Actually, if you don't mind me diving into this part of it.

16-interviewer
Um, what I'm thinking is because the study is trying to keep it to the Kong vault. I might stop the recording. So I can do the transcription for what we've discussed so far. But then if you want to carry on talking, I'm more than happy to.

16-participant
I could summarise I guess.

16-interviewer
Yeah. Sure.

16-participant
Instead of reading everything, um, a lot of woman I surprisingly found that it wasn't so much that they thought it was dangerous. It was that they thought that only strong, able bodied, beautiful woman could do it. And I was like, Oh, my God, that's sad. I mean, I expected that to be a reason but I didn't think I'd get that many votes on that specific reason. Another common one that shocked me, what was it, just not having enough resources, access to resources, whether it's online or a gym. A lot of them said that the the gyms they found were too far away or too expensive. Which sucks because that's what Vermont is, just everything is like a half an hour away, and we're not urban at all. So it's not like you're going for all this traffic. It's just long roads and countrysides. So those were the common themes of that survey.

16-interviewer
Kind of sounds like the first one is kind of an image problem for the sport. It's, it kind of looks like something only elite athletes can do.

16-participant
Exactly. And like it's like you had to remind these people like you do realise these athletes started just like you. They didn't know how to do this shit. They trained really hard, it's a discipline just like any other sport.

16-interviewer
I suppose it's the problem with you know, all the all the people getting big on Instagram and YouTube and things is you're kind of seeing the end of the process. You see the the really good videos, which are amazing for people to put out but you know, it's like someone telling you I don't know. They like to run on the weekends and you go Oh cool, how many ultra marathons have you done? And it's like you're jumping right to the end. The more extreme versions, like no, I do all my training on the curb outside. That's something that we encounter over here quite a lot as well.

16-participant
Yeah, social media is definitely, has everyone like social medias given everyone the tool to edit. So they edit whatever they think their audience wants to see. And our audience has low attention span, hence doom scrolling on social media. And so they think all they want to see is the the successful result. Which is why I respect a lot of athletes who posts their complete video, compilations of their endless fails all the fails, it's so it's like, I find more joy out of watching those fails than I do this, the cool videos and successful successful videos, because it's just that's what people need to see. Like, this is what Parkour is just failing, failing, failing, but learning how to fail successfully, meaning safely. So another common thing in the womens survey was, I didn't know the right progressions. Therefore, I was scared. Well, I can teach you the right progressions. If you come to my woman warrior class, so that you are confident and feel safe to train by yourself. Because training by yourself as scary and clueless as it can be, it can be a great way for you to be comfortable with yourself and learning at your pace. You're not pressured by people around you in class who may be a little better than you to push yourself, you know, so I could go on about this. Parkour in general. Yeah.

16-interviewer
Well, we've kind of hit all the main things I like to try and get through with people about the Kong vault. So unless there's anything else you want to add, I'll stop the recording. Yeah.

16-participant
I was curious, actually, if you'd be okay with me, sending me this, so that I can share my social media and not like all of it just fill up parts like, are important for me to share to my viewers who may be interested in learning parkour or understand the culture of it.

16-interviewer
Do you mean the recording or the finished study?

16-participant
Both or maybe?

16-interviewer
Yeah, so I have no problem sharing the recording. The only thing is I'd need to wait until I've submitted the thesis to release any kind of data from it, which would be in September, so it would just have to be after that. Yeah, it's a little way away. I'll stop the recording and we can keep talking.
