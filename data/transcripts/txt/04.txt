There we go. So thank you for, for coming along today. I really appreciate it. You read the information sheet that I sent over, the thing that you signed. Was there any, any questions about anything in there that you weren't sure about? Or anything you want to ask?

04-participant
No.

04-interviewer
Okay. So I guess the good place to start is just to kind of explain a little bit about what I'm hoping to achieve. I'm basically trying to just talk to a bunch of parkour coaches, about some of the movements that we do in parkour, some of the techniques, particularly the ones that kind of, you know, we've given names and, and perhaps could be identified as like, parkour, specific techniques, and how people kind of understand those things. Bearing in mind that, you know, it's kind of a decentralised sport. At the moment, there's not like a central rulebook or guideline or anything. Although, you know, things might be moving that way with governing bodies and whatnot. And just kind of how it's how that stuff kind of come about, quite organically. And I picked the Kong vault, just because it's quite a well known parkour movement. But I guess the first thing I should check with you is, is that a terminology that's familiar to you, kong vault?

04-participant
Oh yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm surprised that you're using kong vault, I would have expected catpass based on your accent.

04-interviewer
Oh really, is it? Do you know if one is used more than the other in certain areas?

04-participant
Yes, kong vault. So my understanding is that a lot of the UK scene as well as Australia uses catpass. Whereas in the United States is almost all Kong vault.

04-interviewer
Okay. I don't suppose you know why- go on.

04-participant
So the terminology was originally Kong vault was invented by a group called Urban Freeflow. So they originally called the vaults, a monkey vault. And then I think it was Blue who did a really giant one, and they're like, that's not a monkey, that's bloody King kong. So then for a while, people would talk about small, like, if you went over a rail, it'd be a monkey. But if you dived into it, it was a Kong. And then Kong just kind of kind of replaced monkey completely, because it was more fun to say, I think. But Urban Freeflow, if you don't know the history had a pretty bad reputation. And so there is also a whole movement to try to get all the English speakers to use the French and the French is saut du chat. And that actually translates as cat jump. But they also call they also called vaults passement. Right. And so somehow, it came in as catpass became the, the purest way of talking about the the Kong vault in, in, in the UK. So every time that I've been in the UK, people just say catpass I've never heard anyone use the term Kong vault in the UK, they know about it. But that's been my experience.

04-interviewer
It's, it's funny, you say that because I'm from the kind of London parkour scene. A few years removed now. But, you know, a few years ago, I was quite active with Parkour Generations in London. And I'm, I'm familiar with the term Kong vault, I would have said catpass was the one that wasn't used as much. So I'm wondering which groups maybe in the UK you might have encountered that were using catpass?

04-participant
Well, I mean, so like, Storror uses catpass, my experience with them when I trained with PK Gen, I thought I remembered it being catpass, trying to remember because I've spent, I was at Rendezvous in 2007. And then I've been to the Chainstore and I've had [name] out here to teach a seminar. But he didn't teach any technical stuff, right? So I can't remember exactly what he would have used him and if I used Kong I'm sure he would have you know, just probably use whatever I was using, but it's it's always funny because sometimes when I talk to like, oh, like, last time I was in the UK I was turning with [name], you know, [name]? And [name]?

04-interviewer
And who, sorry?

04-participant
[name,] back in the day.

04-interviewer
Yeah, that's that name is familiar. Yeah.

04-participant
Rage froobling. Remember rage froobling.

04-interviewer
It's ringing bells, but I couldn't. I couldn't tell you why.

04-participant
But yeah, so I'm pretty sure that [name] worked with [name]. He's worked, I think with everybody. But they are part of the I think they were both part of the kind of Parkour UK coaching group that was separate from [name], a bit of a rivalry there. I think [name] uses catpass, trying to remember, maybe this is interesting. Yeah, yeah. It'd be fun to do a survey. Yeah, terminology.

04-interviewer
It's kind of not the, perhaps the main point of my study. But I have found it interesting to ask people about about the words, literally just the words. And it's, it's funny, trying to trace where they come from, as they, as they kind of spread through communities is quite interesting. But yeah, I hadn't heard that story about monkey becoming vault. Erm, becoming Kong, because of the size before. It's funny. I guess the next thing really to ask is, is just kind of very broadly, how would you describe a Kong vault? You know, what, what kind of movement is it?

04-participant
I mean, my basic description would be a Kong vault is a vault where you dive towards an object or you vault over an object with both hands, and your body passes in between your arms, with your shoulders, in front of your hips through the entirety of the movement. So if a kash vault, the the legs swing through. And in a dash vault, obviously, the legs go first, right? Interestingly, in some of the French community, all of those are described as saut du chat. Anytime that you are basically diving to your hands, and any kind of way with both hands landing at the same time, but that's my the way that we've used it. And the way that we... Yeah, the way that we teach it is, if you're, if your hips stay behind your shoulders, and you're passing or with both hands, and it's symmetrical, then it's kong vault, you know, side a little bit or something, then it's not. Not really a kong vault, you know, it depends, might be a side vault might be just a shitty kong.

04-interviewer
And so what, what kind of things would it be used for? I know, it's quite again, broad area. But-

04-participant
Yeah, well, I would say that for a lot of the parkour community, it's used, because it looks cool. Because it's quite spectacular looking movement, right, or involves a bit committment, flying face first towards an object has a very aesthetic line to it in the air. So it's a fun way to to move. It's a compelling movement, I think it's one of the most most aesthetically pleasing things, it's one of the things that people want to put in their videos is like a big diving Kong vault, you know, or double Kong or big kong precision. My perspective is that Kong vaults, from an efficiency standpoint, are used to overcome wide distances into or out of them, right. So if you have to dive a long ways to reach an object to vault overit, then a Kong vault is the most appropriate thing. If you have to travel a long ways out of a vault, then a kong vault is the most appropriate thing. Other than that, it's, it's, it's not the best moment for in a lot of circumstances, or people tend to use it, because it involves a more complex loading strategy that takes longer and is more subject to failure than a simple running jump, which is essentially the way that we enter, step vault, speed vault, dash vault, lazy vault, all of those have a simple takeoff, or as a loading time. So and then the other thing is that because the hips are higher than the hands, or the hips are elevated, at sort of the level of the shoulders, I guess, the best way to describe this actually is essentially the hips are, have to be above the height of the legs, the legs are in between the hips and the object, you have to not clip the legs. That means that you displace your centre of mass more as you're going over an object which means that you have a longer flight time associated with Kong vault, than with dash vault, stepp or, speed or lazy, which actually makes it less efficient if you're trying to run rapidly from, from a vault from, you know, to get rapidly from running section through a vault to the next one, etcetera. So Kong vault, over a single medium sized obstacle is basically the slowest vault that we have. You have a series of, you know, if you say at a three foot high object that was, you know, a foot wide or half a foot wide, something like that six inches wide, and, you know, five yards in between each one and you ran through them, the fastest way to get across them would actually be a hurdle, just hurdle each one, as long as your strides sequence correctly, the next fastest would be a speed vault or a dash vault they're actually pretty comparable, in my experience, and then a kong or kash would be the slowest, maybe kash slower than they're both they both involve the same type of loading strategy. And then the time when you're swinging your hips through a kash, is can slow you down, depending on your mobility. But what [unclear] forward as you're landing coming out of the Kong is, disrupts your running gait, more than most other vaults as you're hitting the ground. And so it's harder to control running out of a Kong and to return quickly to a optimal sprinting form. But I don't know how many people actually think about that kind of thing.

04-interviewer
At least two. So quite a lot of information in there. What is it about the Kong you think then that makes it the slowest vault? is it just an efficiency thing? Is it, because you're diving forward onto the hands? Maybe? Are they braking in some way? Or like is that is it just takes longer in general?

04-participant
Yeah. So we've tried to break down flow into a series of different characteristics, right? People talk about flow, but what allows good flow, so we break it down into is direction of inertia. So you have control of your direction of inertia, control of your displacement, over the object, control of your rhythm in moving through the object and control of your, your physical structure. So being in a position that allows you to apply force effectively to the environment. Risk management, right? So what's the likelihood that a movement will fail, right? Anytime that you slip or miss, that's going to slow you down, when you're trying to move fast. And the last thing is your ability to orient effectively. So if you cannot see the next thing that you have to move towards, then you're, there's going to be a delay in initiating the movements that you need. So a Kong vault, um... So just let's start with the idea of rhythm, right? So... well, this kind of rhythm and structure goes back a little bit, but your body naturally, like, just imagine for a second that you're sprinting as fast as you can. And you stop and hop in the middle of your sprint. How fast is that going to be? Versus just sprinting, right. So, so you have a structural pattern of gait that connects elements within a parkour sequence, right? Not always, sometimes you're connecting from parkour element to parkour element. But a lot of times you're connecting from parkour element to running to parkour out. So generally, the fastest movement within any sequence is going to be the movement that allows you to get out of and into your running gait with a minimal disruption to it. So a hurdle is a just a, an adaption of the running gait, right? It's the least disruption to the running gait, you can do, right. That vault, speed vault, a dash vault, all involve a essentially, standard running takeoff. You're simply running and jumping with a swing leg, into the vault phase in the air. So that's what I call it a simple take off. So simple takeoff is less complex for the nervous system takes less time to set up. So it's, it's more disruption structurally. So when you think about what's happening to Kong vault, you know, with a split step Kong, right, you, you're, you're going from putting one foot on the ground, and then another foot on the ground like one flight phase one, right to one, flight phase, one-two on the ground. Dropping your hips down, lowering your chest and bringing both arms behind you. So this is a massive disruption of your normal gait cycle. So necessarily, you brake and slow down substantially more, in the entry to a Kong, than you would for another skill, right? And then the displacement is the other aspect, right? So when we're going over an object, we do not want to go any higher than necessary, as we go over that object, because it's a waste of energy, it also means that we're gonna have a higher impact when we land on the other side, which we then have to absorb before we're able to effectively return to our gait. So that's, that's the disadvantage of the kong vault. Because, because you are displacing yourself. It's also the advantage, right? The reason that you can fly far into a Kong vault is because it gets the hips high, and creates all this potential energy that can be used to go forward. That's why you can Kong pre farther than you can dash pre or kash. It's because of that potential energy that's been created by elevating hips. So... so yes, so you're you're utilising a different structural strategy with your body that disrupts the inherent rhythm of running and involves a greater displacement of your centre of mass in order to pass the obstacle than the standard running jump vaults. The other aspect of the kong, is that, it, it's sort of it's not very adaptable to directional control. So you have a very strong inertial direction. In one way, saggitally, basically, right? And you are not, you're very committed to that. And you don't have the option to effectively change direction. So the step vault or lazy vault, it's much easier to, to cut a corner and go in whatever direction you want. So it gives you fewer options, as far as being able to [unclear] it. Also, you have, your, it's much more committing, you have once you dived into it, you can't really stop effectively on top of the object. I mean, you can very, very strong people, you'll see... will do that as a skill. But basically, you can't you can't decide in midair, that you're not going to continue, whereas with the step vault or a lazy vault often you can.

04-interviewer
So I guess one thing I'm curious about then is, is the running into the movement element... Is that, you know, there are ways, various ways to go in and out of these things. So is it does that stuff kind of apply if you're doing it from say, a plyometric movement, like a jump? Or? Or is the running, running in and running out element, kind of an integral part of the Kong vault? As you consider it?

04-participant
Just the base, it's just the base case that we think about, right? There's other cases, like, you know, I think of parkour vault as tools that have specific applications. So if you're doing a movement preceding a vault that involves a two foot takeoff, right, that or sorry, that involves a two foot landing. Right, then often, a Kong vault is a relatively fluid movement to go out but you still have the problem that it's sort of catalyses you just going forward. And, and involves a lot of displacement of your hips, right? And so depending on somebody's mobility, if they're, if they're in that situation, they might want to pop through a kash vault, because then they're going to come up in a more athletic upright position on the other side. But that's, um, really has to do with shoulder mobility, which is a more optimal choice there and compression strength in the core. But yeah, so... if you had two vaults in a row, right, and they're, you know, close enough for a step or two, a couple steps between them, but not like really long ways away. A dash vaults into a Kong vault is very fluid. But a Kong vault into a dash vault is not very fluid at all. The same is true step vaults to Kong or lazy vault to kong and not vice versa because the Kong casts your chest forward. It's very difficult to then recover to an athletic posture and be able to get into a running jump step. So you'll see that those types of sequences much more commonly. You can do Kong to Kong or Kong to reverse vault, because reverse vault is basically a very similar type of takeoff to a Kong vault. But you'll, you just won't generally see somebody do a Kong vault and then do a dash vault right out of it because it structurally doesn't work well, so you need more options when you utilise a simple running step.

04-interviewer
Okay. And...

04-participant
Sorry, I've lost you. Just give me one second.

04-interviewer
Okay.

04-participant
I use an external speaker, the speaker on my computer is broken, so it just died. [pause] Okay, that should be good now.

04-interviewer
Okay. Can you hear me?

04-participant
Nope. I don't hear you. Give me one second. How about now.

04-interviewer
Can I, can you hear me?

04-participant
Yep. Yep, we're good.

04-interviewer
Okay, cool. That's great. That's, that's really, that's really in depth information that you're kind of giving me here, which is great. I'm curious is that, are those things that you've developed yourself? Over time?

04-participant
Yeah. I don't think these are things that are sort of widely known. I'm, and I'm sure a lot of people in the parkour community would recognise intuitively that this is true. More experienced athletes are, have adopted this, but I don't think anyone else has taxonimised parkour in the same way that I have, that I know of.

04-interviewer
Is that, erm, just for your own curiosity and interest in that? Or do you think that's something that we need to be doing in parkour? To understand it better?

04-participant
It depends on what you mean by parkour. Right?

04-interviewer
It's, I guess, it's similar to, you know, what I'm saying at the start about the kong itself. It's a, it's a decentralised sport, people have their own opinions and ideas of what it is and isn't. So it's kind of difficult to say, I guess, you know, just kind of-

04-participant
I think, I think it's a useful thing for anybody in the sport. But I had a particular you know, I, I started in 2005, and I got involved in the forums and all that stuff. And I, you know, went over to parkour dot net and was like, anti Urban Freeflow pro parkour. And, you know, we were told that parkour was, you know, efficiently getting from one place to another. And that's a shit definition, because we, the most efficient thing, most of the time moving through the city is to walk or run on the flat paths or stairways that have been provided for us. So when I started [name], co-founded [name], uh, I created a working definition for parkour for our group, which was Parkour is the discipline of developing the ability to overcome obstacles effectively, and of developing the self through overcoming obstacles. And I've had a chance to talk with Stephane and Sebastian and Thomas, about that, and they all think it's pretty good definition. The one thing that I've talked to them about is that I think that the emphasis in the beginning, especially with the Yamakasi, was much more on the development of the individual versus the way that the individual relates to the, the environment. But yeah, I mean, it's, it's one it's one definition of parkour that's useful. And I think that as far as the broader community is concerned, the best sort of description of Parkour is it's common practices. It's just a practice of challenging yourself through complex movements using, [unclear] obstacles in the environment, right, there's no, there's no real focus in the parkour community in general on effectiveness or efficiency, not as a, not as a central feature that everybody is is focused on. So I did a teaching seminar for [name], and I kind of laid out this theory for them. And then we talked a little bit about like, well, how would you adapt this for free runners right? It's like well, we can talk about what are the components of creating an aesthetic line? Right. Okay, talk about, you know, what is the amplitude of the movements, the novelty of the movements, the, you know, the lines that are created, you know, how do we think about shapes and the, the sort of visual interaction with the environment. It's been a while, that was back in 20... 2013. So I can't remember exactly what I came up with for them. But I think there's, there's more elements that sort of expand out from what Parkour is, once you start playing with the creative and aesthetic aspect of it. But, er, I think that understanding the basics of you know, control of inertia, control of displacement, control of rhythm, structure, orientation, and risk management is fundamental to anybody who wants to play with these things. And then being able to analyse each of the movements as tools that allow you to do that within a specific context is important. You know, I have analogized that a lot of parkour athletes essentially spend a lot of time getting, building new tools to put in their tool belt and don't realise that the practice is actually carpentry.

04-interviewer
I guess that def-, that idea of the things is a toolbox I've heard before. And just kind of bringing it back around to the Kong vault, do you consider the Kong vault to be a good thing for people to have in their toolbox?

04-participant
Absolutely. It's a very useful movement. It's just utilised frequently a lot more than, than it would be useful for. Right? Right, you'll see, you know, you're gonna see people doing Kong vault over things that are knee high to precision, right? That's, that could stride that much more efficiently, which, and it's fine. It's fine to do. Right? There's nothing wrong with that, right? Because there will be lots of things that are inefficient in order to challenge ourselves and explore new options. What happens a lot with less experienced athletes or athletes who haven't applied this to say a speed run context, or haven't timed themselves haven't played with these things, is because the movement is aesthetic, and it has high prestige, they over apply. So when we run when, so we started some of the first speed competition through [name], back in 2011, no 2009, started in 2009. And what we found is that if we put a series of boxes out, you know, that were enough space to take a couple steps in between vaults that a large percentage of our athletes would default to using a kong vault. And, and it was always slow compared to the other options that we had. And so there's, there's just from an efficiency standpoint, or effectiveness standpoint, there tends to be an over emphasis on the skill, right. And reciprocally, something like the hurdle is almost completely undeveloped. And in a lot of contexts, it's by far the most efficient.

04-interviewer
Do you think people kind of default to the Kong vault then? Because it's kind of like a just a popular movement? Or is it like, it's, it's something that's kind of, I think you might have said, it looks good?

04-participant
Yeah, it just looks like-...

04-interviewer
[overlap] It's like, Yeah. Because the thing I always noticed is that whenever they put it in, like film or TV, that's what they kind of go for, because it's it's something that people go, Oh, that's parkour.

04-participant
Yeah, yeah. It's kind of emblematic.

04-interviewer
Hmm. Yeah, that's a really good word.

04-participant
Yeah, it's emblematic of parkour. And it's something that a good athlete from another sport can't automatically do. Right? Like, a good football player will self organise a speed vault or a hurdle or a lazy even in a chase context, right. But you generally have to have trained it in order to have access to a Kong vault. So it's a bit of a separator, right? It sort of says, I am a parkour athlete.

04-interviewer
Do you think, erm, and it's maybe it's coming through experiences as a coach as well now... Is it something that's easy or difficult for people to learn?

04-participant
It's one of the more difficult, you know, the, what you might call the base vocabulary of vaults. It's probably the most difficult of the basic vaults, right? This is a toss up between that and the kash but, um. Generally, the Kong vault is more limited by fear and by strength, whereas the kash is more limited by mobility. So if you're working with a population of say, you know, really strong muscle bound young men, they'll kong more easily than they'll kash. But for, you know, a more mixed population, you'll find the kash might come easier.

04-interviewer
And I noticed you said, fear, as well as strength. Is it something that people people are scared of? As a movement?

04-participant
Yeah, yeah, it's, it's quite a scary movement, because there's a sense that you can clip your feet or your knees, and that you'll be tumbling headfirst, if you do so. And just even the idea of diving headfirst at an object is kind of scary. Right? So yeah, I think, definitely more fear involved. And there is a higher potential of of taking a bad fall from a Kong vault than from any of the other vaults.

04-interviewer
So what, I guess what kind of, how might you break it down for someone learning? In that case?

04-participant
Yeah. What we've gone to is just having people practice konging up onto things. And getting them comfortable with that. And then we sort of work on konging up further onto something. So if you know, you know, you're konging up on a six inch wide box, and then maybe have a two foot wide thing and you just kong from one side to the other, then you take them back to the six foot, six inch box and just have them kong and use the same strategy to get far over the kong they come down on the other side. In the past, we played a lot with like Kong vault on the ground as a way to progress up. But we found that those were not necessary in a lot of contexts, once we moved to training primarily in nature, where we have a bit more rounded surfaces more likelihood to have soft landing spaces. The other thing that happens a lot in nature is you'll have branches that have a little bit of a dip in them that provide really nice services for learning, the kong or the kash flow, because it's easier to get the feet through without clipping. And so we found with with with that set of constraints, we didn't need to use a kind of a ground kong based strategy to accomplish it for our athletes.

04-interviewer
So if I'm curious if the kind of version on the floor was not, does that translate very well to doing it on an obstacle? Do you think or does that? Is it? Is there something different about? I guess I'm thinking of the dive on a completely flat floor versus diving up? Or kind of in an arc, or anything like that?

04-participant
Yeah, I mean, obviously, there are differences, right, the idea of teaching it on the floor is that you're just learning to feel comfortable diving onto your hands and then driving the hands down and back in order to get some flight after the hands contact without taking the risk of falling from a two or three foot high obstacle, right. The reason that I've moved away from that is one, I just found that the athletes didn't need it. But the other is that I'm very, very kind of deep in ecological dynamics slash constraint led approach to learning. I don't think that it's everything, I do cue people and use a cuing language. But within the motor learning research, what they find is that if you atomize a skill more in development of the skill, then you're actually more likely to see the athlete have the skill sort of separate into its component pieces under pressure. So the more that you can get an athlete to sort of adaptively have access to the skill as a whole thing, the better the athletes retention of that skill over time is. So when you're working with a novice athlete, you part of it is they have a motor control, like lack of understanding of the skill. But the other thing is that you might just have an athlete who's not physically strong enough, and not physically mobile enough. And a lot of times, it's better to just address those components and then let them self organise the skill. So what we found with many of the vaults is that they self organised given the right task demands. So rather than teaching the step vault, what we'll do is we'll go out and find a couple of tree branches, or maybe a couple of rails in the city and just say go under this one and go over that one. Right. Something like that. And you'll what you'll find is that most people can figure out how to do a step vault, and it will naturally occur. And then most people will also do a one handed lazy, right? And maybe a lazy with both hands touching. And then you can, you can, you can just nudge the skill a little bit to get them to put their hands down. Alright, to get them to get control of the hand positioning. And even the Kong, the Kong vault, people will self organise coming up onto things, right, they will do that naturally. So we try to put them in a context where it's like, get up on top of this thing, and that becomes the obvious way to do it. And then we can watch, then we can shape the skill, once it's there a little bit, you could say, Okay, well, now I want you to get all the way over it. Right? You know, watch how the athlete behaves. And then, you know, you can put a different context in front of it, that that makes them that elicits the behaviour more that shapes the behaviour in the direction. So, sometimes we're able to do that successfully. And sometimes we need to use more cuing to kind of give information to the athlete, and depends on the context of like how, how much time you have to work with the athlete and kind of what the what the progression, you know, that you're trying to achieve in a specific timeframe looks like, but I would default to taking more time to give the athlete the physical resources to achieve the Kong vault and more context in which it just makes sense to utilise that skill. And less technical cuing information is going to be a more robust pathway in the long run, in my opinion, even though you're likely to get the, this, the shape of the skill earlier, if you do more kind of technique drilling and cuing of it.

04-interviewer
I'm, I'm curious, because you use the word context for the movement there what, what might, what might the context for a kong vault be? If it's not the fastest movement?

04-participant
So... Well, the first one is that you use it to get up on things, konging up is very natural, right. So if you're, if you're approaching, you know, like, imagine a loading dock, right, you're running up towards a loading dock, and you want to get on top of the loading dock. If you imagine that you want to be in a good running position, symmetrically with both feet on the object as quickly as possible, often a Kong up is the fastest movement, right? If you swing, if you do like a step vault mount, getting your body back into position to get to have both feet under, you have more of a problem of direction of inertia with that lazy vaults don't work as mounts at all, or dash vaults, right. So you're, you're basically your two options are some kind of two hands support, or one hand in one foot support, those are the two things that you're going to do to get up on top of something. So if you get people comfortable getting on top of things by using that strategy, then they're they're not so far away from a kong vault. And if you're running around in the natural world, right, like we're kids, you know, might in, in, you know, more evolutionary past, like you're running around on fallen logs and rocks and stuff like that, that task demands going to come up, a lot of people will self organise this skill, it's a natural skill for human beings, what's less natural is something like flying 10 feet out of it, right, that's more of a, a particular context that we've built. But you know, once someone can get up onto something, you can focus them on just getting further down the thing that they're getting up on, and then you can have them target going over across something instead. So then something you know, like, with my son, six years old, and so he's playing with some of these skills, you know, so he kind of naturally was doing a sort of knees to the side, Kong vault, right. So, like a context that we can put in front of him is that you need to land on something and stop on it right. And so now the knee swing around the side is going to, is going to be potentially less useful because it's going to create more of a wobble when you land. So the kong to precision actually is a way to, to make obvious to the athletes self organisation that, that having the legs pass in between the arms is is a better, is a better strategy or tactic.

04-interviewer
And so if if you have an athlete that did me more of the like, cuing side of things, if perhaps just the context stuff wasn't getting it across them or they weren't getting it in straight away what kind cues might, might be looking at giving them? Or, what, what kind of sticking points might people have with the movement?

04-participant
Yeah, so there's a few different, like, there's a bunch of different aspects of the kong you can look at. And so one aspect is the takeoff, right, because once we are more advanced, then we need to specifically address how we do the splits, foot takeoff, which shows up not just in the Kong vault, but as I mentioned, also in the reverse vault, and, uh, running front and side flips, right? You see this same basic takeoff structure, in all of them. My, my nice webcam died. So that is a less natural movement for people in some ways. So it takes a lot you can, you can get benefits from a little bit more specific focus. So that's, that's one thing that we can cue and then we have the what the arms are doing and how they interact with the object, like a very classic error that we see with athletes is having their arms out in front and kind of reaching forward with them as they vault. And the problem with that is that if the hand is still moving forward, when it contacts the object, it makes it much more likely that someone is going to slip. So you need to cue athletes are often a very important cue to give athletes is to pull the object back and behind them. Giving them a target to land on that's further away will also tend to elicit that same behaviour, right? Because they're having to, they're trying to get somewhere, right. And then there's, you know, the legs deviating to one side or popping one hand up early, right? To get through. And again, having a target that you're going towards, provides context for why that's less optimal. So then cues again, it's like, you know, drive down and back with both hands, right? If you can get that and then, you know, keep your legs in between your, in between your hands. You know, that's a pretty classic one. And then when we when we look at the, the, the split step, what I tend to do is have people stand where they can take one step and drop into it. And and then just, you know, it's it's obviously better to sort of take that step, right. And so then if they hop and go to two feet, then I can put a barrier and say, Okay, well, only one leg can go past this barrier. With the arms, you know, we we cue, the arm should be down swinging forward, and then pull back. So those are some of the cue structures that we use.

04-interviewer
I've heard that described as like a scoop. Maybe, yeah,

04-participant
Yeah. That's a good one, scoop.

04-interviewer
Is that kind of the arms on the obstacle part, is that contributing to maybe distance? Or is it just to kind of-

04-participant
You can control your distance.

04-interviewer
Yeah, right.

04-participant
So so you're pressing down, so your, your, your body is pushing down into it, so that's giving elevation and then you're adding momentum by pulling on the object. You're, that's not the most powerful component of the moment. I've never seen a biomechanical breakdown of how much the legs versus the arms are contributing to the movement forward. The arm swinging actually is quite is quite important because having the arm swing as your contacting the ground having them swing down, it adds momentum going down into the ground which increases ground reaction force. That's why you see you know in a counter movement jump-

04-interviewer
This is in the takeoff?

04-participant
In take off. Yeah. Years ago [name], if know [name] is extremely talented parkour athlete from [name], he you know, he was one of the first guys who did like triple Kongs on video. He told me that basically he thought the arms did almost nothing and that he could Kong almost as far off of two fingers as he could off of his whole hands. But [name] who is my my, the co founder at [name], he had a very unique style is extremely powerful and muscular and his upper body and he could achieve kind of massive distances out of the press with his arms and you can see it you know, we have a video of him doing like a double Kong where the first one was 36 inches and the Second was 48 inches, with like a six foot gap between them. And you can look and you can watch how his arms are bending and pressing in order to elevate his body more to go over. And so is kind of he was kind of a joke in the parkour community because his his upper body strength was so exceptional relative to other people that he had a different set of options. And so we kind of joked that he was like a gorilla and drug, drug his lower body around by his arms. So yeah, so it depends on the athlete and their, their structure.

04-interviewer
So would it, I guess, would it be fair to say that, you know, that kind of upper body strength can play a role, but it's it's not kind of... It's not the most usual way? That people-

04-participant
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I would say that. The, the, the timing of the swing, and the way that it hits helps the action of the legs and assists always right. And that very powerful athletes in their upper body can can gain advantage in pushing. But the advantage gained by having a more powerful upper body is less than having a better time, more rhythmic and more elastic, lower body. And so you can see there's, there's quite a few, you know, I mean, [name] is actually exceptionally strong in his upper body, so maybe that's a bad example. He's kind of skinny. But I mean, you know, he's insanely powerful with his dynos and stuff like that. But you see, some athletes who are quite slender and you know, don't necessarily have like really powerful climb ups who can Kong vault extreme distances, because just the power of their legs.

04-interviewer
So the takeoff kind of gives them a lot of power. And then the upper body is just to kind of pass the obstacle?

04-participant
Yeah.

04-interviewer
So that on the kind of, we talked a lot about the takeoff and the obstacle, like on the other side of it, what, what kind of thing might you be looking for, for good Kong vault?

04-participant
Well, once you get into advanced kong vaulting, and there's really two different skills that we call Kong vaults that are related, but have some require different things. And that's a vault to precision and a diving vault. So in a vault to precision, you want your hips to sort of be rising and below your shoulders the whole time. In a diving vault, your hips go over your shoulders. So when you're doing a Kong to precision, one of the key things is actually not letting your hips elevate too high relative to your shoulders during the passage over the object. You know, aside from that, you know, essentially you're just correcting for your rotation in the air, and tucking up and reaching out as you would on any jump in order to accomplish, you know, as much distance based on the parabola of force that you've created. But that's, that's the big thing is that if you, if you're doing a kong to precision, and you let your hips elevate too high, you're you've basically created a shorter, tighter arc rather than a longer arc. [unclear] But on a dive, you know, getting those hips high is very, very important because you have to catch on the other side and have time for your legs to translate through. So you see the best, the best guys in the in the double Kong dive kong, often have, you know, almost like a 45 degree angle when they're coming into the end of that, that that, you know, the the second or last the you know, the final hand placement.

04-interviewer
One thing I find curious is when we start talking about other movements that are kind of distinct but still within like the Kong family of movements, or do you think they are... Like, is it just literally that two hands feet through the middle thing that kind of connects them all? Or are they, do they share more than just a kind of aesthetic?

04-participant
Well, um, so you can break you can break things down in different ways. So you can look at how is the athlete taking off? How is the athlete landing and how is the athlete moving over the object? So I tend to think of the complex takeoffs and we'll call them you know, for lack of a better term. Those are the takeoffs were both feet on the ground during the takeoff phase, the two foot takeoff jumps right. That's the Kong vault, the, the reverse vault, the and the kash vault basically. And then you know, Kong front [unclear] whatever. Double leg, uh, you know, all th fun- funky ones. And then then step vault, lazy vault, dash vault. And hurdle all takeoff have a standard running step. And then you have some, some things like gate vaults and chest vaults, and swing leg reverses, which are a little bit different, you know, a little bit, you know, kind of neither. But that's the way that I break them down. So, a Kong vault and the kash vault, they're very closely related to each other, the fundamental difference is just whether the shoulders stay in front or the hip swing through to move to the end of it. I find that a kash vault is much easier on my body, when I'm doing it say, over something high. That we know that having my hips and having my hips get lowered, before my hands leave the object allows me to land much more softly on the side, also has a really nice control factor. I discovered this when I was training, I got, uh, I like to move in trees, right. So I was teaching and in Australia, and we have this incredible banyan trees, you know, and so I found these trees where I was able to do you know, parkour lines on tree branches, you know, 30 feet off the ground. And I found that a lot of times, you know, that the position that your hands are in is higher than the position your legs have to travel through. And that a kash vault gives you a lot of ability to sort of swing through and land symmetrically on an object and not have any inertia moving in the wrong direction. Or even a step vault can be very, very intimidating, when you're trying to land on a relatively narrow branch 30 feet off the ground. Because it has that small... Step vault, has a natural tendency to fall off to one side, and has a natural circular momentum. So, so I quite like those for for control when we're doing the kash vault. Um... But when we're teaching the kash vault, when we're teaching the Kong vault, I tend to teach the kong vault first. But many athletes will self organise a kash vault when you ask them to do a kong vault. And when they do that, I always just said that is this vault, it's really useful. We'll practice that for a while. And then we'll try to bridge back to the kong vault from it. If you can, if you can do a kash vault rather than a Kong vault, we will give you a gold star for getting a really cool vault. We keep you doing it for a while because it's, it's useful for you. And then we return to the Kong vault and say, okay, here's the manipulations, the changes we need you to make in order to achieve this other vault that has these other purposes. And then, and then you have something like you know, like a two foot takeoff, lazy vault, right, or a two foot takeoff dash vault, which occur in certain situations. And so those are somewhere hybrid in between these types of skills, right? I don't tend to spend a lot of time teaching those basically, once. Once athletes are sufficiently advanced, they, they'll they'll sort of find those, right, like you pop down. You know, we talked about the situation where you're, you're not running into an object, but you're actually landing out of another. So you do an underbar and you land and then you're going to vault, right? And so you're not going to step into the vault, you're going to be bouncing into the vault. And so you can bounce into a kong and you can bounce to a kash and bounce into a lazy, right? Maybe a dash. Athletes who, once they're really sequencing those type of things. They kind of have the ability to self organise and figure out what's going to work in that situation. Especially if they have clear goals on like, get here fast, you know.

04-interviewer
I'm conscious of the time. I'm gonna monopolise your morning too much. Yeah. We've we've actually covered a lot of the kind of main points that I try and get to with people. It's been really really great, really interesting. I guess just to kind of to wrap up if there's anything, anything more to add that's kind of popped into your head at any point maybe we didn't get to.

04-participant
No, no, now I'm just like, man, I need to publish this stuff I haven't like it all exists behind my, to some degree behind paywalls on the, you know people buy my online courses, right all the all this stuff, but maybe I'd love to put out some some longer kind of like nice, nice content that just sort of broke down why, why the skills have these relationships, what the basics of flow are. But yeah, just just reminds me of that. But yeah, I hope I hope it was useful.

04-interviewer
Yes. Very, thank you. Cool. I think in that case, then if, well I guess, to finish the thing, I've been kind of asking people, and I'm not sure. I'm not sure what your answer will be for this, because I think you've maybe thought about these things in a different way. But is there... Is there anything about the Kong vault that you would like to find out if you are able to take it into a lab and have like, all the sports science kind of equipment? Is there things that you're curious about in terms of? Or...

04-participant
Yeah, I mean, one of the big ones that just popped up in our conversation is what is the contribution of the upper body to the total force applied during a Kong vault, right? So like, if you could look at, you know, force plate on the ground, force plate on the hands and say, you know, how much of the, the the distance attained, how much of the total force was contributed by the lower body versus the upper body? That'd be quite interesting to me. You could do you know, I don't think you need a laboratory to find out the other questions that I have about it. I think that those are mostly contextual. And you can see it and you can just time it, right, like I've done frame by frame analysis of like, speed runs. And I can, you know, I can see that, like, you know, so when [name] route did a dive, dive Kong over two rails as part of a series, uh, part of a course, right. And some of the athletes slid under those two rails and some of the athletes did strides over those two rails, Yon had an amazing time. But if you watch it frame by frame, you can see that he loses time compared to almost every other athlete in that specific sequence. Because there's no necessity for that movement, right? A stride is faster. And in that context, or even the slide was faster at that context. So I mean, it would be fun to sort of test out different, different places, different sequences, right, coming out of this skill. But, I mostly think that you can just test that yourself by going out into your environment saying, okay, here's the here's the series of obstacles, I'm going to timee myself using a Kong vault here versus using a different skill. I mean, my basic thesis is that if you can use another skill to accomplish the same effect, you're usually better off doing so. Right? I mean, I guess the one exception to that would be that, sometimes you like you can do dive reverse vaults, right. And they're like, a lot of times, if you try to dive into Kong vault, if you try to do a dive Kong, and you're not going to make it your knees are going to clip than the default, the bail strategy is to reverse vault, you turn your shoulder and it allows your hips to transit over the object lower. But the problem with that is that you now have disrupted your orientation. And when you have a longer perceptual lag when you hit the ground, and you're less optimal structure to keep moving forward. So if you can make the kong rather than the dive, reverse, it's better and, it's interesting, you never see people really practice big diving reverses. But yeah, I mean, that that's, that's my thesis, I think you can test it, that athletes can empirically test it out themselves, most people just haven't have a thought to do it. But relative control contributions would be good. I mean, you could test some of the things that would be interesting is if you look at, if you look at the takeoff in a Kong vault, it's very, very similar to the takeoff for a dunk if you watch people dunk but if you watch-

04-interviewer
In basketball?

04-participant
Yeah, if you watch a two foot basketball takeoff on the dunk, you'll see the same positions moved through largely that you see on a Kong vault or a a guy front or side ball, side foot. Now, when you do a Kong flip- Kong vault or a front flip generally the feet will be pointed directly forward towards the direction of travel. When you do a dunk they will be slanted like this. So one curiosity is can we use some of the spiralling  asymmetry to get a little bit more power and be able to correct the hips in the air? Or do we sort of need to, right is this, is this, is this the optimal strategy that we've, that we've already found? Or is there a little bit of that we can steal from basketball? I suspect that we've probably already found it but be an interesting thing to look at. The other is like, there's all sorts of interesting things like if you start looking at the basketball, the analysis of basketball takeoffs, there's a lot of stuff that you could look at in like the the action of the arms, right, like, you know, like [unclear] talks about arm flaps versus arm swings. So where where do the arms come through. And you know how the athlete loads, like how they get their hip down and roll over the foot. And looking at the relative contribution of the blocking or the the penultimate step versus the blocking step. Like all those, there's probably interesting questions that you could, you could generate around that and get some information that athletes could take into sort of cue their practice on how to do things better. But I'd have to think a little bit more about how to shape those questions in order to get useful data out of it. But that's, that's some directions you could look at.

04-interviewer
That's really interesting what you said about basketball, because that had never occurred to me before. But as soon as you say it, I can kind of picture it in my head that the rhythm of the feet and things like that is, yeah I can see that. That is very interesting. Okay, cool. All right. That's good. Then I'll stop the recording. If you could just bear with me one second.
