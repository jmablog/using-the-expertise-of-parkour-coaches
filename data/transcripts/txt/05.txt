...start the recording. All right. So. Good afternoon. Good morning for you, actually. Thank you for, thank you for coming along so early in the morning. So just very quickly, just to check, thank you for sending back the informed consent form with the signature on it. Was there any questions about anything, any of the information in there that you wanted to double check? Okay. And similarly, thank you for doing the background, detail thing. That was all great. Just one thing I wanted to ask quickly, says on there that you're not currently coaching, is that, um, although you're not active, are you still kind of with a coaching group? Or is that just you're not coaching at all?

05-participant
So I'm not coaching at all right now. I have a, I have a spine injury. So I'm not doing a lot of training in general. But I do sort of, we take a hiatus during the winter, but we have like a weekly women's group that I organise, and do a bunch of the sort of facilitating of people's movement there. I guess. I'm not like, we don't use the term coach, because it's a community. But we will be starting that up again in a few months. So I'm not actually you know, I'm not, I'm not actually coaching right now or training, but that will be happening soon.

05-interviewer
Okay. And that, um, those training sessions, they're are they part of [name]? Are they completely independent thing?

05-participant
They are independent, but it's, it's basically the women from the [name] community, and then we do some outreach on their behalf. So like, we have we have, we're definitely not we don't belong to them. But we have like flyers for their business. And when people come over and say, like, Hey, what do you guys doing? You know, we let them know, most of the people who train in that group train with [name].

05-interviewer
Okay, cool. So the the main thing that I'm kind of looking at with this study, is trying to get an understanding of how people and coaches kind of understand the Kong Vault for themselves. The kind of reasoning for that is that, you know, there's no central rulebook or, or guidelines or framework for parkour, it's not like a sport that's been enshrined in some kind of central organisation, although some of that stuff is starting to happen with governing bodies and things like that. And so when it comes to performing studies on the movements, it's kind of a little bit, it's very open. How do you know that when I'm doing a Kong vault is the same as someone else's? How do I know if I'm studying that? I'm not just studying one person who's doing something very unique to them? And I'm going, ah the Kong vault everyone does it with you know, they do a triple handstand first? And then they do and with? Like, no, no one does that. It's just that one person. So I'm just trying to talk to a whole bunch of people about about the vault. It's, the questions can be quite broad. You know, I've got some notes written down for where I want to, what I want to talk about that. We'll see where it takes us as well. So don't feel that there's any kind of like, right or wrong answers. Just , just go with that. Cool. Any. Any questions before we get started?

05-participant
No.

05-interviewer
Okay. I mean, I guess I should check. First of all, do you know what I mean by Kong vault? Is that the term that you use?

05-participant
Yeah, yeah, that's the term we use, me. Sometimes there's a bit of confusion, um, like in America, I think people tend to say Kong vault, but I have run into people who say Monkey Vault instead. And I think sometimes there's a little bit of sometimes people will define that slightly differently. But I, Kong is the, is a word we would use in the sort of north of Boston community.

05-interviewer
Okay. Do you, do you know, perhaps where you first heard it? Is it is it just the word that everyone uses? Or is it particular to anything?

05-participant
It's pretty like pretty much in our in our sort of standard lexicon of like, Oh, you know, today in class, we're gonna work on this thing. I don't know that there was like a particular video or anything that was first showed to me that was like, this is the thing I think it's just like a sort of a name brand vault that you would learn in class.

05-interviewer
Okay. In that case, then with the Kong vault, just kind of curious, let's say starting really broad, how would you describe it just in your own words?

05-participant
Okay, so...

05-interviewer
In as much or as little detail as you want.

05-participant
So a Kong is a vault that uses like a feet hands feet pattern as many of like our vaults do. But you do two hands at the same time and typically propel yourself forward over an obstacle. And they're they're sort of variations that we would also kind of put in the Kong family of like a side vault where you don't necessarily go forward, but you put your hands down, and then you hop your feet sideways and don't necessarily have to do they're like feet, through the space where your hands were movement. But in a standard vault that I would consider a Kong, just like a normal Kong, you put your hands on the obstacle, and then you hop your feet through the space where your hands initially were, and you press with your hands to pull your chest and shoulders out of that space to make room for the clearance of your feet.

05-interviewer
Okay.

05-participant
I think I tend to see it done. Perhaps not equally... in equal measure, but you see people doing it both as sort of a split step coming in or a punch coming in. I wouldn't say either of those wasn't a kong, I think it's just a different setup for it.

05-interviewer
I'm really curious that you use the word normal, as in a normal kong. Is that... Is there like, um, yeah, I guess like a main version of it, that comes to mind when you hear the word kong vault.

05-participant
So I think, um... in a lot of the, like my community I think has proportionately a large number of adults practising and, and adults who came to the sport as as adults who didn't start out training when they're 15, 16 years old. And so a lot of the the Kongsthat these people are doing or I shouldn't put it in air quotes, a lot of the Kongs that these people are doing are not the, the sort of standard sort of straight on Kong, you know, you would you would side Kong in those instances, or, you know, it's just a little bit less taxing on the body. I was told pretty early on in pretty damagingly in my training that I was not a real parkour practitioner until I could do a Kong.

05-interviewer
Really?

05-participant
Yeah, it was it was framed as this like this barrier to entry, this gateway of like, I, I can't respect you as a practitioner until you can do this. And I was told that by a coach, and it sort of led me on this very self destructive, three or four months long quest to do a kong, which was like, a really painful part of my parkour experience. It was like, a time where I was very frustrated, I felt like I didn't deserve to work on anything I like doing until I nailed this thing. And so I was like, just sort of hammering it constantly. I had every coach I think we have maybe 15 coaches in our community or like coach adjacent people who all sat down with me and tried to help me, tried to troubleshoot, they all wanted to be the person who like unlocked it for me. Um, you know, and any just wasn't working, it was extraordinarily frustrating. And so I think, in my mind, and not rightfully so the, the straight on sort of perpendicular Kong is, is like, the real kong that is like the difficult one, that's the barrier for entry, as opposed to sort of the side Kong. Which it would be great if we consider that as like, you know, as interesting or as cool as a normal Kong, but for me, because there was that barrier put in place it like, yeah, that definitely affects how I would describe it. Even though I recognise that that's like, that was a damaging perspective that was like, imparted upon me.

05-interviewer
Do you know why they maybe had that view of it? Why it's, why it was considered so important, in a way?

05-participant
I... it's hard to tell if this is like a widely held viewpoint, because this person was like a particularly intense person, but also someone that like, I wanted to train with and like, you know, wanted to be on their good side, I guess. So. Um, you know, I think it was just like, in his mind, it was Like just a, like, a hard thing that if you can't do, you're not part of the group. But it was specifically the barrier of entry for being a practitioner. I mean, it wasn't like, Oh, you know, like a kong these other things, you have to be able to, like, do rail pres or do any of this other stuff. It was it was the Kong that was the thing.

05-interviewer
Just the one, the ones main movement.

05-participant
Just the one movement. And it sucked. It was like it was a really difficult three months.

05-interviewer
Yeah, I bet that's, I've not encountered that anywhere else. Okay. That's really curious. So just coming back to your learning it then what, what was, what were some of the things that were kind of stopping you getting it? Just out of curiosity.

05-participant
You know, I think at the end of the day, part of it was just like... like, there's so much in parkour or just like, believing that you can do it and not having your mind put the brakes on at the last second is like really important. And I think at the end, that's what it came down to. Because when I finally did my first one, I was training with someone else. And he was like, really struggling with something. I was really struggling with this. And he was like, it was like, the end of the day, we were both exhausted. And he was like, Alright, I'm gonna nail on this one. And then you're gonna now yours and then we're gonna go home. And then he nailed it. There's sort of this, like, just psychological moment of like, Alright, like, 100% commitment here. 110% commitment. And then like, it happened, and it like, totally blew my mind. Because it's something that I've been, like, just like rote practising for for literally months at that point.

05-interviewer
Mmm.

05-participant
So it was like, kind of a magical moment, but then I like told the person who initially told me that I wasn't a practitioner until I could do a Kong. I was like, You should have been there today. Like, I did a Kong and he was like, I was busy. Like, he was like, so not impressed. And it was like, it was crazy, because he was such like a, it was such a pivotal thing that he had said to me, like it was the thing that really was burned into my understanding of myself as a practitioner, and whether or not I got to be part of that community where I got to consider myself, you know, someone who did parkour, it was it made such an impact on me. And then like, for him sort of not the same. Like he did not care at all, even though we were like good friends at that point. He it just like, I don't know, the whole thing was like a weird, disheartening, frustrating moment until, like, when I tried, when I teach Kongs. I try to do it very differently.

05-interviewer
Well, I was just about to ask if you now share his point of view, when it comes to coaching it with other people.

05-participant
I do not I, you know, I don't think anyone needs to learn a Kong, I still do not regularly use them because they're not comfortable for me. And I don't think that there's any minimum barrier for entry. There's someone in our community who really tried to recruit people into our 50 plus class, we have like, an older folks class. And he tells them, if you get out of bed in the morning, you're doing a roll and a height change. So like, there's no like, there's no minimum for doing parkour. And I think that's a perspective that I'm much more comfortable with. And I think in particular, because I work with a lot of women, it's really important to have that as part of our like, like, the respect level in our community space is that like, everyone who shows up here today, to like, train or to have fun, or just to play or just to see what it's about, like, everyone is part of this. And it's okay, if you if there's something you can't do or don't want to try, or, you know, if you're tired, if you're just gonna sit on the ground and stretch next to us, like, that's fine, you're still you're still a part of our movement community. And I think, I know, perhaps I perhaps I've sort of swung the opposite way in terms of [unclear] pendulum, and want to have a super inclusive approach to parkour. But also, I think, when we're talking about women's parkour, you have to be very inclusive, because it's difficult to recruit women to parkour. It's difficult to retain them once you have them there.

05-interviewer
Okay, cool. So if it's, if, erm, so not thinking of it as like a requirement to say you can do parkour. Do you still think the Kong vault is an important move to try and learn in parkour or is it something that is, I don't know, not required, but it's like a fundamental movement, or do you think it's just, just another one on the list?

05-participant
Yeah, I mean, in that it's part of our vocabulary of movement. I think it's useful for everyone to like, know what it is and try it. If it doesn't work for you, I don't think that matters at all. Um. But I do think that, you know, same as like, if you're learning parkour, you're going to learn, or you're going to know what a lazy vault is, or you're going to, like, have exposure to these other vaults or these other movements, you know, you're going to know what QM is, you're going to have all these things that are just part of our vocabulary. You know, if you do it long enough, you're gonna run into the Kong. And I think that's, there's nothing inherently wrong with that.

05-interviewer
But it's, you don't view it as like, essential or something, something that someone has to get?

05-participant
No, I mean, I think, I think our proper practices are pretty personal. And because we don't have this sort of curriculum of how to learn parkour, and how to teach parkour, if something is like, very difficult for you, for whatever reason, like I am very small, and like, I am lady shaped, and all the people trying to teach me to Kong were like, men with a typical athletic build where a foot taller than I was.

05-interviewer
Mm.

05-participant
And I think their understanding of how to do the movement was different from what actually made sense for my body at the end of the day. And I think, if no one had... I think, if no one had sort of framed the Kong as something that I needed to learn to do, I would have had a much more healthy relationship with my entire parkour practice during that period where I was going to do it. So I don't think it's like, like, if you want to be on a team, and you want to, like compete, or you want to, like, have an elite level practice, like, yeah, you should, like, master your movement and learn all the things that you can, but if you hate them, there's no reason to do them. Like there's no, it's not like, like, I don't know, I want to say like, it's not like swimming, where to get to an Olympic level, you have to be able to kick your feet well, and fast and strongly, you know, it's like, there's just, theres, because there's no structure in parkour right now of, you know, like, yeah, we have some competitions, we have some, some versions of that, but none of it requires you to do a Kong and it doesn't, you know, if you don't like it, if it doesn't make sense for your body, if it's just like a huge point of frustration for you, I don't think that like, we need to put a sort of moral weight on whether or not you get to be a part of the community based on any individual movement.

05-interviewer
So is there kind of a feeling that there's always other options? You know, there's nothing that perhaps a kong, like that only a kong could achieve something in that, in whatever situation? There's always some option?

05-participant
Yeah, I think usually there's like a, something you can swap in for that. It's not like parkour's choreographed. It's not like there's someone saying, okay, here's the dance, we're all gonna do identically to each other. It's not like that. And I don't know, I think some there's something like very personal about everyone's movement and their style of movement and what they enjoy doing. And you know, I don't think that has to include any movement that people are not comfortable with, like, I don't know, like if someone doesn't like heights, and they don't want to train at height, and then they don't want to, like jump off a roof. Nobody's gonna be like, well, you're not a parkour practitioner, if you're not jumping off a roof. Right. Like, they're, they're still playing, they're still doing the vaults or the swings or, you know, whatever it is. It's not, um, I dunno, I think everyone's practices as individual as they are, in many ways.

05-interviewer
Yeah, I would definitely agree with that. Okay. Do you still... do you think it's, it's a popular movement, though?

05-participant
Oh yeah.

05-interviewer
So kind of... Yeah?

05-participant
People love kongs, I think. I mean, they look cool. I think they're an easy way to like impress people who don't do parkour and they like, they look like a lot of fun. I often teach parkour... or I often teach Kongs to the women who are in my group sometimes because they want to learn it sometimes because I think that they ah, need a challenge at that point. And, you know, I don't think that it's not a useful vault. I don't think it's not a popular vault. And I also don't think that it's not worth trying to learn. I'm glad that I, you know, put in the hours to make it happen. Mostly it happened in a more positive way, but I'm glad that I can do it. So... does it, yeah, it's definitely popular people like it.

05-interviewer
And is that... do you think it is something that is quite uniquely parkour is it a movement that you see in many other places?

05-participant
I don't think so. I do think that it's something that kind of looks like parkour me like if I saw someone doing it out in the in the wilderness, I would definitely say like, oh, that person is doing parkour. Yeah, I would consider it you uniquely parkour.

05-interviewer
Hmm. Yeah, I always, whenever I see it in TV or film or something, it always seems to be the movement that they go for, to show that they're doing parkour, this person can do parkour. Mm. So, just to just to rewind a little bit back to the movement itself, then. Could you kind of talk me through how the movement kind of breaks down? If that makes sense. So you know, what, what situations might use it in I suppose, might be a good a good place to start.

05-participant
So I think, because this vault, obviously, you're going to use it with an obstacle that's probably between most often things something is like knee and chest height. And people do all sorts of variations on them, so double Kongs and everything to do obstacles that are wider, but you have sort of a moderately sized obstacle. People can often kong over it. And usually, like if you were coming in perpendicular and hoping to leave perpendicular to, if we're assuming like a wall, you would you might use a kong. Um. Because it is... it's sort of a straight line movement. Same ways, like a lazy, lazy vault, is this, this straight line movement, but parallel to a wall? That's sort of just 90 degree rotated. Are you asking me to describe the movement itself? Like how...

05-interviewer
Yeah, like, if, if you were gonna, I guess if you're gonna coach it to someone, what would you... How would you kind of break it down for them?

05-participant
Well, if I were coaching, I would demonstrate so they would have like, a thing, and then they would understand that a little bit better. But essentially, you would walk towards the obstacle and then either split step or punch to sort of jump into a hands down position and have your hips up, and then push off from the, you know, push off from your hands where your weight is, in order to rotate your shoulders up and your hips down, to get your feet through as you move over it so that you can land on your feet on the opposite side.

05-interviewer
Just to check when you say punch thats, uh, kind of two foot together jump?

05-participant
Yeah, like a two foot takeoff versus a one foot takeoff.

05-interviewer
Why would you use either one of those?

05-participant
I think I would just specify either or because I think I've seen people do it both ways equally successfully. And I think sometimes when you're learning you watch the person who's doing the demonstration and say, okay, they're doing it that way. So I have to do it that way. But I'm more comfortable with a punch. And that took a long time for me to figure out like how to do it differently. But I do think it's important to know that like either takeoff can work.

05-interviewer
Do you think it makes a difference to the movement which one you use?

05-participant
I think with a split step, you have the option of doing this sort of like kick behind you that can give you more momentum if you're having trouble getting your hips up. So depending on, you know what kind of troubleshooting we're doing how what problems a student is having getting over the obstacle, I might recommend one or the other. But if you're more comfortable with one and it just makes more sense for your body, then I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone from the punch.

05-interviewer
Okay.

05-participant
I think it's a little more like, if you're first learning and you hit, like, when you first learn a movement, you can only think about so many things each time you go through, you sort of blank out in the middle of it and you end up on the other side, you're like what just happened. And so there's, you know, you don't want to overload them with information. And I think the punch is just a very simple you know, set of things to remember, you don't have to remember a lot, whereas the split step and adding the kick and adding the hips and everything, it's just it's just a little bit more to think about. So if it doesn't come naturally to the person the first time, um... you know, it's something I would add in later and not have that conversation right off the bat.

05-interviewer
So that might be more of a progression as they as they get more used to the movement.

05-participant
Yeah, and I will say like, because it took me so long to learn to Kong, I was presented with many, many drills of how to work on different pieces of it. And so there are plenty of things that I would use as as progression pieces to the kong.

05-interviewer
Could you give me some examples?

05-participant
Uh, yeah. So one of the things that so the pop on was a thing that we did a lot, a lot, a lot where you would approach the wall as if you're going to do a kong, put your hands down and then jump, do the, like hands to feet replacement, and put your hands down, or put your feet down where your hands were before. And then gradually try to move where your feet are landing from behind your hands to where your hands were in front of your hands. So eventually over the obstacle. So...

05-interviewer
So, what was the, was there a, um, name that you used...

05-participant
[overlap] A pop on?

05-interviewer
...for that? Pop on? Okay. I like that.

05-participant
[laugh] Slightly different from a pop, pop vault. But, um, yeah, so it was basically just this, like the Kong but without clearing obstacles. And I find most people, especially like younger adults are flexible enough to do that, if I was teaching like a 40 or 50 year old, sometimes it's difficult for them to like bend in the way to get their hands and feet in the same place. But typically, I would start with a pop on. I was also given one where you sort of start in like a downward dog position where your hands and your feet are both flat on the ground. And then you push off your hands here. So we stand like your weight is in your heels and you lean forward a sort of like rocking horse back and forth to get used to that push motion in your hands. Because it's not so much like an elbow push, a lot of it comes from your shoulders. And so working on like activating the sort of the shoulder push in addition, and I don't think that really had a name but...

05-interviewer
Hmm. The, er, is the upper body important to the performance of the Kong, in that case? Or is it all from the takeoff...?

05-participant
Yeah, it's definitely... definitely... it's definitely important in some ways, I think, to this day, part of why I don't use Kongs that often in my personal practice, and like I'm not still super comfortable with them is because something I'm doing with the push off in my arms doesn't feel strong enough. And unfortunately, I can't tell you whether that's a strength problem or a technique problem. But there's definitely like, your arms are definitely an active component of the movement.

05-interviewer
So are they... are they pushing you off the obstacle or are they just re-orientating your torso?

05-participant
You know, I have heard it described as like, You're, you're pulling forward. So you're like to clear yourself over the obstacle. I have heard it described as pushing down on it so your shoulders can come up so your hips can sort of reorient themselves down below you sort of like pivot yourself around your, your horizontal axis. Or, like, you know, or just like getting your body out of the way so your feet have space to come under you. You know, I've sort of heard it described as having many different motives or like different directions to push in. But I think most commonly, it's like the scoop. It's like, it's just to get yourself past it.

05-interviewer
So, I mean, you mentioned strength, is that, is that something that's important to the vault? Or is it flexibility? Cos I know you mentioned as well about being able to get the feet up to where the hands are in the pop on. Do you think one is more important than the other, do you think it ...kind of doesn't matter or...?

05-participant
Um... you know, I've seen people that I don't think are super strong do Kongs before, I don't know. I'm trying to think of people who I know who aren't super flexible. I definitely know people who are not that flexible who can do Kongs as well. So I think you can honestly I think if you are very flexible or very strong, you can compensate and do sort of a sloppy Kong in either direction. But I think a lot of the movement is technique, you know, I think you shouldn't have to be super super flexible because ideally, you're not stretching up into that little ball like a good Kong has a little bit more space in it, it's a little bit more floaty so you have time to get your hands out of the way of your feet underneath. So I don't think you have to be super flexible. And I also don't think you have to be super strong. I think a lot of it is mental. And then a portion of it is obviously technical.

05-interviewer
So the mental part, is that what you said about kind of letting go a little bit and being able to...

05-participant
Yeah, I mean, I have just like many videos that people sent me of like me doing a Kong and they like trace over and they say like look, here's like your arms are straight up and down and like before you take them off the wall, they should be like a little bit further behind you or whatever. And I think just committing to letting myself drop over the edge when there was no limbs in front of my face was really hard for me.

05-interviewer
Mmm.

05-participant
And just, yeah.

05-interviewer
I know from from my own experience, the diving part was what was always kind of strange to me the idea of just throwing yourself forward in space.

05-participant
Yeah, so I, I was a competitive swimmer before I came to parkour. So the the diving feeling is like the most comfortable part of the kong that's like something that's, that my body just like, I wouldn't have to think twice. And I feel like I can consistently dive in a fashion that would be safe and usable for my body. So I'm definitely like, an anomaly in that because of my past experience. But I didn't feel like the dive was hard for me. But I recognise that that's not everyone.

05-interviewer
So it was the other side of the obstacle, that was the scarier part?

05-participant
Yeah, it's like getting, getting over the top and coming down on the other side, for sure. Um, was definitely the difficult part.

05-interviewer
So, um, so what, what kind of things are you looking for, or coaching or anything like that, for the, for once someone is over the obstacle? Are they are they landing... are you looking for them to just land and stop, or keep moving like what what kind of things happen... On the other side of the obstacle?

05-participant
A lot of times, you'll see people do sort of like Kong pres, where they will try to stop in a very specific location. That's cool when they do it. But I think when I am coaching Kongs, or doing Kongs, I think it's in my mind, being able to continue moving out of it is like, like, a more functional piece if you're adding it to a route, and you're not just like coming to a standstill. In some ways, obviously, like there's some very, very difficult kong pres out there. But I do think that when I'm teaching it, I want people to be able to continue moving from it. Because I don't know, when it comes to a kong pre like you can always put like a precision trainer exactly where you land, and land a Kong pre every time. Whereas moving out of it and being able to decide where you're going, like, while you're mid air or keep continuing the movement, having the flow from it. I think that's a really like, useful thing to teach people. And then they can go and learn to do a kong pre in their own practice. But I think when I teach it in like a group setting, moving out of it fluidly is important.

05-interviewer
Mm. What, what kind of thing would, um, would affect the ability to do that? And what would stop you from being able to move fluidly out of it?

05-participant
So I think if you don't have a lot of control, like if you're sort of just hucking yourself over the obstacle, or you know, we sort of touched upon it with the flexibility thing. But if you don't have the space to control your descent, you might just like come down when you come down and your feet sort of like slam into the ground and you're, you know, you've functionally stopped your momentum wherever you are. So I think having the control to create space within your Kong dictates whether or not you can keep moving fluidly out of it. And because that space in that control is important to whether or not you're like, your Parkour is working. I would say that, you know, that's an important thing for people to work on.

05-interviewer
Mmm. So you, are you trying to get people to land, um, it running, and to land on one foot and keep moving or still landing two feet that split. What kinds of things are happening?

05-participant
[Not] sure, if there's a hard and fast rule, whether or not you can come out split foot versus at the, you know, landing at the same time. I certainly wouldn't draw a line there. I wouldn't say it wasn't a kong if you did one versus the other. But I think it depends on what you're doing next. Like if you're trying to do plyos after your kong and sort of do these, like, bounce off onto something else or, you know, change your direction, then maybe landing two feet makes more sense. But if you want to like if you want to run or stride from it then maybe landing one foot makes more sense. I think it is pretty much dictated by your environment and what movement you're trying to go into next.

05-interviewer
So it's very situational.

05-participant
Yeah.

05-interviewer
Okay. But kind of like with the split for takeoff or punch takeoff. It's like, there's a few different variations, but they're all still a kong.

05-participant
Yeah, well, I think I think the defining factor of the Kong is the like two hands down at the same time, and then hopping your feet over. And then if you want to get more specific about it, hopping your feet over in the same space where your your hands and arms were.

05-interviewer
Okay. So that kind of bit over the obstacle is, is kind of the defining...

05-participant
Yeah...

05-interviewer
[overlap] ...Part.

05-participant
...it's like what it looks like in the air. And I think part of that probably also comes from, like parkours lineage as an internet sport, where it was like a lot of people watching and copying, and not a lot of people like teaching for the first couple of decades. And so, you know, I think people probably like what it looks like in the air and what it looks like when it's photographed, is, has probably more... a bigger impact on whether or not it's a kong, than what it looks like, on the you know, the approach or the getaway.

05-interviewer
It's a bit of a strange area to try and talk to people about because I've tried before and it can get a little abstract. But, you know, I think you mentioned earlier like the family of Kong movements. Do you feel like there is like, an iconic Kong? That is like, you know, when people say the word Kong, this is what comes to mind? Or do you think it's all just situational and open and people chop and change and they're all, they're all Kongs?

05-participant
Yeah. I mean, if someone says Kong, I'm imagining they're going like they're taking off they're going two hands on the obstacle, they're moving the feet through as a, you know, described, I think within that family you have side Kongs, where your feet don't go where your arms were, but you also have ground Kongs, which are like the quadrupedal movement version of a Kong where you're on the ground, there's no obstacle and you're just sort of moving forward by doing this hands, feet, hands, feet hop. Or I dunno I think the the sort of hands feet pattern has a lot to do with whether or not it's categorised in the family of Kongs. But if someone says kong to me, I'm imagining the sort of the standard model where you see in movies where they like, tuck their feet up, and they push off their arms. Do that, I don't have like a specific video that I would link to and say like, this is the Kong but they're out there like they're that's how everyone does it. So I'm gonna guess perhaps your study isn't everyone doesn't do it that way. So...

05-interviewer
Well, no, that's what I'm trying to find out. It's, it's really interesting talking about it with people because it seems to be something that almost becomes intrinsic, after you've done parkour for a while people go, Oh, yeah, you just Kong that. And you know what they mean? But no one's ever actually gone... This is a Kong vault, or this, isn't... It's a bit strange to think about, this kind of decentralised definition.

05-participant
I also, I mean, I think it's worth noting that, like, I am part of what I think of as, like, an early generation of student coaches, like, my coaches didn't have coaches they are, they're self taught. Whereas like, I was, I learned parkour predominantly through taking lessons from people who knew how to do parkour. And we're all certified, to coach those movements, and parkour. And so I think, that definitely, like, changes my experience with learning it. For better or worse, but I do think there was someone who sat me down on one day and was like, Okay, today in class, we're gonna do kongs. And here's what it looks like, here are the pieces, which I think most of the people who are coaching at this point did not have, or, you know, some of the younger coaches did have, but many of the coaches in the sort of, like, late 20s, into their 30s range right now are all pretty much self taught. And so there might be more variations within that group on how they sort of define it. I would guess, I don't know.

05-interviewer
So when it comes to, to the Kong in that case... What are the kinds of the things, particularly if you're coaching it, perhaps, that you kind of take as, um, signs of success in the movement? What makes a good kong versus a bad kong? I know you mentioned space a little bit earlier, but... 

05-participant
Yeah. So I think like, there's obviously like, the fundamental pieces of like, putting your hands down in the right place, getting your feet, like clearing the obstacle, all of that, like the first mark of success is just like having the pieces in the right order, and going where you want to go with them. I think that's a big part for a lot of people and particularly, like, when you teach these in class, that's like the sticking point because, like, if you're if you're learning it on your own, you can do it until it works for your body. Whereas if you're in a class, you have like 10 tries, you're in a rotation with other people. You can't stand around and think about it, there's like a time limit, and you either like, already can do it or you're not gonna be able to do it today, I think a Kong very much is something that you have to go and do your homework for. You can't learn it in class, you have to go out and figure out how it works for your body. Or maybe you don't, because it already works for your body, maybe, you know, there's some people who it's very intuitive to and they can just do it. Um. And so I think that's the first like, like, the first breakdown is like whether or not you can clear the obstacle whether or not like the pieces all are there. I think you can have success before you do that, like doing clean pop ons, sometimes people have a lot of trouble getting their feet to land exactly where their hands were, um, their feet are a lot behind their hands. So like an early, you know, success, because I don't want success to only be can you do the vault, right? When you're learning, you have to have points of success that happened before success at the very end. Because otherwise it's very frustrating, discouraging. And so whether or not you're you're getting your hands to replace your feet, I think that success on the side of not clearing the obstacle. But I think there's success, there's like even further versions of success beyond clearing the obstacle. And obviously, that's like how like clean and floaty it is if your hips are super high, then maybe you can transition to a double kong, if that's what you're interested in, or, you know, you have control exiting it because you have you know, enough push in your hands that you're you're really getting your chest up. And so then you can transition to kong pres that are, you know, in different directions or farther than, um, farther than you're jumping before. So I think I would, I would put points of success out cautiously sort of draw a line of whether you're clearing the obstacle or not, and then put various points of success on either side of it. Because I think there's always there's always something more cool that you can do. And there's also always, you know, improvement that can be made before you've sort of reached the like, the success point.

05-interviewer
So thinking perhaps, as well as more like experienced practitioners, so not just beginners. You know, you mentioned distance there, is that something that people work on? Is that is that important to the movement, being able to travel farther over the front, once you exit the movement?

05-participant
I feel like you're framing these questions as like, is this important? And it like, I just would like to make it clear that I don't think any of it's important, in some ways. Like, I think if you are interested in doing it, it's important if it's something that like, you feel fulfilled by working on, it's important if it's, if it's a part of your practice, it's important. But like, if I don't ever care about doing a kong pre then like it's not important. If I don't learn, I'm still a practitioner, people still, you know, can do other really cool things. Just because you can't do a kong pre doesn't mean you can't flip doesn't mean you can't train at height or you can't rail balance or any of these other things that are all also important parts of our practice.

05-interviewer
I mean, I completely agree. Like it's... I guess it's from a, from a coaching point of view. 

05-participant
Yeah. So...

05-interviewer
If you're gonna do Kongs in class, what might you work on? I guess is maybe a better way of putting it.

05-participant
Okay. So I think I mean, the vast majority of people that I'm working on Kongs with are it's, it's early on in their sort of exposure to Kongs. So they're not at the point where we're doing like, Kong to rail pres, or they're not doing like, you know, sort of more advanced versions of the movement in my sort of wider training community where we like, are all going out and like having a jam on a Saturday afternoon. Yeah, kong pres are like super popular. The, the distance that you're sort of kong pre-ing out of, is definitely something you'll see people working on, like if there's, you know, a specific and again, it's like, obviously, with so much in parkour, it's location specific, where if there's something cool that they think they can maybe get to after a kong, for sure, they're going to spend two hours like trying to get to it. But that's less of like a coach thing, like you're trying to get there. And it's more people who know their bodies and know, like, what they've done in the past and say like, Oh, yeah, well, this is like this is close enough that I think I can make it here within today's session.

05-interviewer
So I guess maybe would a better way to put it be that success is perhaps more just whether the individual achieves what they want to do in that environment? At that time? Is that a good way to put it like...

05-participant
Yeah, I mean, because I think it really like... I think... A more useful version of this conversation has to do with like, or like takes into account, the level of the practitioner like if they're new success might just be getting over it, or if they're [old] success might just be getting on top of it. Or if they're, you know, if they've been training for a long time success might be nailing that rail pre that's like super far or like, finally thing like a double Kong or something like that. But I think it is, it's very dependent on, obviously, where someone is in their, in their practice. And so I... I know that I'm not like giving you a, an answer that's like really makes that much sense. But I do think it's like, so important to that conversation, like taking into account where a person is and having markers of success along the way, because, like, the people who were coaching me and tried to get me to do a Kong, all they cared about was me getting over the obstacle. And like I was struggling so hard to get over it. And it was such a frustrating, and like, discouraging experience because like I just couldn't hit that mark of success. And there was not a lot of like, okay, here are other things that like you can work on along the way, and you can get good at and have success in. And ultimately like that will turn into the conflict. I never, at any point of the three months felt like I was making progress. You know, it always felt like I'm just throwing myself at this. I'm trying to listen to people's suggestions, but like nothing is, is giving me better perspective. And I think, I don't know, I still suspect. And I don't have any data to back this up. But I still suspect that part of that is because I have a very different body than people who are coaching me. And so...

05-interviewer
How does that make a difference to the performance of the movement? Is it, uh I dunno, easier for tall people? Like what what kinds of things you think make a difference for the, for the movement?

05-participant
So we we talk about like your ape index, which is like how long your arms are in comparison to the rest of your body. And so like, if you have really long arms, you have more, you should have intrinsically more space below you when you're doing a Kong. And it means you don't have to get your hips up as high, you don't have to have all of the different like, perfectly very, balanced variables. To clear the obstacle, it's just like you have more space to do it. I also think that like, I am quite small. And one thing that I run into all the time is our vault boxes are designed by people who are six feet tall, and also have been training for 15 years, and they look very approachable to them. And to me, you know, they're they're 20% larger than they are for anyone else. And so it's definitely much harder to learn at max power than like a medium power level. And for me, there's no other option than to try it at max power. Or else like going outside and finding a concrete wall, which like, has its own intimidation factors, because people are watching you. And because, you know, there's hard ground on either side of it and all of that. And so, for me, a large part of like making it work was finding an environment that was designed for me like that made more sense for my body. And I think it happens a lot of people in particular, we're like, the space is designed for the sort of traditional parkour practitioner and like, the rest of us sort of muddle through as best as we can. But also, like, I, again, I'd like don't have any science to back this up, but like, my hips are a lot wider, whereas like, they carry a lot more of their weight, neck, shoulders, and so like getting my hips up, and like having the arm strength there to like, push from your shoulders. It's just a different experience, I think. And my hips are like, because my hips are wider than theirs, like them, having their hands at shoulder width is different from me having my hands at shoulder width, or them telling me to like, you know, like, swing my like, in an L sit, right where you're like, they're my hips are like wide enough that my, my arms should be kind of where my hips are where the guys like their arms are straight down. And it's just, I'm... I am just balanced differently enough that some other suggestions, or the things that work for them don't quite make as much sense for my body. And it took a lot of time with, like, figuring out how like, just on my own without input from them. I'm trying to make sense of what pieces of that advice I needed to discard. And I think I mean, that's that's a huge part of why I became a coach, right? Because like, there weren't female coaches in my community. And I thought it was just like, it was not fair. And so you know, I mean, I don't like I don't like to say this is fair. This is not fair. It's not like, you know, who knows what fair is but, like, at the end of the day, I felt like the women in our community were being underserved and in a certain way, because they're like people with their experiences weren't represented on our coaching staff and like not represented in who was designing our equipment and, and all of that. And so now I've gone off and like feminism tangent, but I do think it's like the way the way your body is balanced, definitely changes the way you move sometimes.

05-interviewer
Mm. I do find that really interesting what you said about like the distribution of weight between the hips and the shoulders. I find that really interesting. Because one of the things that I'm kind of interested in is the, the biomechanics of the Kong vault. That's actually something really worth I think, investigating.

05-participant
Yeah. So there's a video I'm sure you seen, like from from the YouTube channel parkour science, where they talk about the girl role. And about how essentially, like, if your hips are, your centre of mass is lower, you should be rolling in a different way, because the regular roll doesn't protect you. And I have like friends who went to MIT and like, studied biomechanics. And so I like, spent several months with them trying to like figure out if the science behind this video is sound, and if whatever. And ultimately, like, they decided it was like a maybe but like not super conclusively. But it's a hard thing to study. And I think like, people have tried before, but I'm always like, cau-... cautious to preface by like, this is anecdotal experience. This is like how I feel about my body. But like, it's a hard thing to study. I've [laugh] I wish you luck.

05-interviewer
[laugh] Thank you. It's, it's interesting, because the first place my mind kind of goes is where you're also talking about the height of the obstacles. And obviously, the higher the obstacle, the more effort it's going to take to get hips up. So it's like a double whammy, two for one, in terms of making it harder for you.

05-participant
Yeah. And then whenever, like, I'd be like, Okay, well, let's, you know, we have like tires in our gym that like have have flat tops on them. So we would like, sometimes stack them and be like, okay, like, Can you kong off this, and then the guys would come over to me and be like, you can't kong on that, like, it's too low, it's way more difficult to kong on something low. It's like, okay, but like, it's, it's too low for you. But like, what you're like, you just aren't, you see the world through different eyes than I do, right? Like, you're just, you know, and like, I need something a little bit lower to learn on. I don't know, I think it's, it's a thing that I didn't even notice I went to, to visit a gym, like a couple communities away. And it's run by a husband and wife, couple, and the wife is about my height. And I was like, Oh my god, like, every everything that I thought I couldn't do, every vault that I've ever struggled with, is suddenly working on this day that I visited that gym. And at the end, I realised that was because they're vault boxes were like a little bit smaller. And I came back home and I was like, talking very excitedly with the other, the other coaches, and I was like, wow, like, everything suddenly makes a lot more sense on these lower boxes. And the guy who like owns the gym up here was like, Oh, we do have lower boxes, there at the middle schools, where we teach kids classes, you can go sign up for one of those. And I was like, you know, it was obviously a joke and, like, we all laughed about it. But like, in my heart, it was like, he was saying, like, this space isn't for you. Because you're small and a woman like, we didn't build this for you and like, suck it up, you know? And so... I do think that like, in all of our, our sort of our science and our industry, in our conversations about parkour, there's this like, intrinsic, like, built in lack of women's perspectives, and a lot of this stuff is like, very frustrating for me to like, especially at this moment, right now we're like... and sorry, I'm getting way away from kongs [laugh]

05-interviewer
[laugh] It's okay.

05-participant
Especially in this moment, right now where like, parkour businesses are like, our, it feels like finally really starting to put roots in and become established in the parkour like, you know, being on TV in America, we finally have world chase tag, and like, you know, all of these things like it feels like we're finally starting to put down roots, but we're putting down those roots without the perspectives of people within the community that, like, will... We're building in systemic barriers that we don't have to build in. And so like, I don't know, just it's just frustrating to watch. And obviously, I know we have to build those things quickly, because there are all sorts of external threats trying to build them for us and not do a good job serving our communities until like, I respect that. But I also want women's voices to be represented in those spaces. [pause]

05-interviewer
Do you think that, um... Just to come back to the kong vault a little bit, is it... [laugh] Sorry, it's the title of my study, I have to try. Um...

05-participant
[laugh] Of course.

05-interviewer
Is it something that is, you find common for women to learn, er, hard to learn? Do you think it's on, depends on the individual?

05-participant
I do think it depends on the individual, because I definitely know women who cannot Kong and like really struggle as much as I do. But I have known plenty of women who have come into one of my sessions and been like, I've never done parkour before but I want to learn something parkour-y, and I've been like great, let's try Kong vault. And within an hour, they've been just fine doing it. So it's hard, it's hard for me to say whether or not women struggle with it. Because I also think that like, teaching from a woman's perspective, like I might teach it slightly differently. And so it might be hard for people to learn, but it might also be hard for them to learn because, because they're learning from people with a different experience in them. But then again, like also plenty of women are, you know, very slim, or have narrow hips or, you know, are not built the way I'm built. And so it's hard to make a blanket statement, you know, and say it's like, either harder or easier for them.

05-interviewer
It's um... it's funny you say about a blanket statement, because that seems to be what I am coming up against quite a bit in this study is that... it's very individual. Is that, is that fair to say?

05-participant
[overlap] Yeah.

05-interviewer
[overlap] Like, the movement as a whole.

05-participant
Yes, I mean, I think there are certainly standardised pieces of the Kong but whether or not you want to use it, and how difficult it is to learn and how you do it definitely, like, there is a personal element of it. There's a personal style one in anything in parkour, but there's also, you know, like, technical aids that people use, whether that's, you know, you're not super flexible, so you're stronger, and you sort of muddle your way through it, or, you know, there's just people do it in the way that makes sense for their body. I think.

05-interviewer
I suppose the thing I'm trying to find out then really is what what are the standardised parts? You know?

05-participant
[unclear]

05-interviewer
-consider... Sorry, go on.

05-participant
I think I would, I would put sort of the the, once your feet leave the ground to once your feet leave the ground on the opposite side, like that whole portion in the air feels like you can sort of distil that to a like an ideal version of that, I think coming into it or coming out of it. There's like variations depending on your, the space that you're doing it in. But once you're, you know, once you leave the ground, I think the pattern of like two hands in the middle. Um, and I know I've just like saying this over and over again. But like two hands in the middle, hips up, push off with your hands, and then like feet forwards to get you, get them back under you.

05-interviewer
And the kind of... the kind of ability to come out of that with control and connect into whatever you want to do next is kind of the thing that you're aiming for there?

05-participant
Yeah, I mean, I think if you're trying to do like a good Kong, if you're trying to make it look nice, obviously, you want to have control, you want to have space in that you don't want to look like you're just like kind of curling up into a ball and hopping over it. Which you see a lot of people who don't have the sort of strength or the confidence to dive into it. Yeah, like, the, the more space and the more control you can have in it, the prettier it's gonna look. And if you're, if you're shooting for a pretty Kong, then like, that's what you want. But then like, there are a lot of people who just want power in their kong like that, like if you're in World chase tag and you're trying to kong over something you just want to be fast, right? You just want to get away from someone else. And so I think if you try to distil it into like what the goals are there, then you also run into problems because there's so many people use parkour for so many different things. There are a lot of people in our community who just like you like a spin class, you know, they go they get their exercise and they go home, it's not part of their like, lifestyle. It's not part of their like, don't go out training on their own or like hanging out with parkour people as friends. It's just like, purely fitness based and for them doesn't even matter if they clear the obstacle, right? Like just the jumping like is getting the tone in their butt that they want, you know, like there's the I think you can't get too specific with the goals. Because again, there's, there's just like so, so many things that people want to get out of Parkour and parkour has so much to offer that. You know, you can't just say that that, oh, you know, everybody wants this from it because there's so much. Parkour has so much going on.

05-interviewer
I guess my question then is, we may have already talked about this a little bit, is, as, when it comes to coaching it. Obviously, it's very individual. But as a coach, there has to be some, you know, you're doing if you're delivering to 20 people, there's some there's something you're trying to get across. Right. So what is it just being able to clear the obstacle in that case, that's the priority that you're kind of working on?

05-participant
Yeah, I mean, I think part of being a good parkour coach is to, like, work with whoever's in your class on that day. And so like, my, my goal, as a coach on that day might be to get as many people over the obstacle as can do it on that day, but also to continue challenging the people who can do it easily. And also give successful options, you know, an options for success for people who can't clear the obstacle. And so I think, yeah, the, the first thing I would say is like, getting people over the obstacle, following the pattern of what makes it look like a kong is like, it's sort of number one, but also, there gonna be some people who can already do it. And so giving them like a precision trainer on the other side to shoot for, or, you know, like another vault box, and they decide to like kong in and go straight into another movement, maybe like a plyo in there or something. Um. You know, you then can build out your environment to give people other things to do. Or you can scale it back and say, okay, like, if you can't get over the obstacle, doing these pop ons, or doing this, like rocking horse motion to get used to the pushing your shoulders. You know, I don't think... I think as a coach... and as a good coach, you have to be prepared to interact with students who can both do it and not do it already. But I think the goal is to get people over the obstacle, and then they can work on whether they want to do, you know, a floatier version of it, or a precision afterwards, or any of those pieces, those I think, are sort of, like more technical add ons. But like, for me, just getting people over the obstacle in the pattern is sort of the the first bit because I work with, you know, more beginner level students.

05-interviewer
I really like that. Um. The idea of the add on. It's a nice way of thinking about it. I'm aware of the time. So we, um, I don't want to...

05-participant
I'm not in any rush, so-

05-interviewer
I don't want to monopolise your day. I guess really just kind of... just to finish up, is there anything, either just as a practitioner or coach or anything like that, anything about the Kong vault that you kind of want to find out or anything that any questions you have about for yourself? Or? It's okay, if the answer's no, for this one. It's just I'm curious if there's anything that people are like, I want to know whether this makes a difference, or I should do this or...

05-participant
Yeah, I mean, there's... I mean, there's so much that, you know, you could wonder about and especially because of all of the problems I had, there's like, there's a lot of things that I want to know, like a lot of advice that was given to me that I want to know, well, was that really true? Like was that actually like something I should have been thinking about more what would have helped me to be able to do that thing they were recommending. But sort of at this point, in my training, the thing that like is most important to me is like, like, how, how much does your centre of mass change how you do this motion, like, because I work with women, and because I am woman shaped, like do I need to be offering like, adjusted advice from the advice that was given to me by the men who taught me, um, are some of the things that I just parrot because they were told to me, not necessarily useful to the people that I am parroting them to. So, you know, and then that centre of mass distribution, but it's also like, I hear people say all the time, like, oh, put your feet, like hip width apart. And hip width for women and hip width for men is like, oftentimes different. And so like, you know, it's like, we create all of these little, little pieces in how we jump that we talk about it in this way, or, you know, we use this vocabulary to describe it. And I guess, I would just want to know, like, is it as useful to half of the population, you know, obviously, not half the population, but maybe we would have an easier time recruiting and retaining women into our sport. If we were better about it. Talking about how to train them, or if we were better about, you know, talking about their movements. And so I guess my big question would just be like, Is it different for people who were, you know, balanced, who tend to be balanced in this way versus people who tend to be balanced in that way. But then it's because you're factoring in like, height, centre of mass, like, width of shoulders, and hips, and all of that other stuff. So that's like a big other project [laugh]

But I mean, that that's the kind of stuff that I hope to move towards. I mean, this study is, um, kind of a factfinding thing to start feeding into that stuff. Because the thing that I didn't want to happen is to start running down that road of investigating stuff, with numbers and measurements and all that stuff and actually have then the parkour community turn around and go, we're not interested in any of that, or something like that. So. And also, I think what's really interesting is... the idea of the kind of conventional wisdom that's just kind of sprung up around parkour, just because it's been passed on word of mouth. And, and as you as you say, is that correct? Or is it... Should we actually be saying to our students, do it this way instead? So I think those are some really important points to kind of talk about.

I think maybe simplifying it to one gender neutral question is like, where do your hips needs to be? Because people were always telling me get your hips or your hips higher, but they were the same people I'd see do Kongs with their hips, not ever getting higher than their head, you know, anything, there's a big fear factor and getting your hips up, because suddenly you have the ability to like, tip in directions that like, you know, you lose stability, the higher your hips get. And so I think that's it, that was a big thing for me, it was like, just like, how high do they actually need to be? Plenty of people do them very well without getting their hips up. [laughs] That's my like, one really specific piece of it.

05-interviewer
No no, it's great. It's definitely something that... immediately my brain is like, yeah, because that makes sense. Because if you're, if you're stronger, or you know more, your weight, it's more distributed towards your shoulders, perhaps you don't need to get the hips up as much because you can push off the obstacle higher and create more space for yourself.

05-participant
This helps as well, especially like your hips are probably lighter, comparatively. Whereas like, if you if your centre of mass is lower, and your hips are heavier, comparatively, both getting your hips up. Like if your centre of mass and your shoulders and your hands are planted firmly, you don't really have to worry about like your stability is okay. versus if your centre of mass is lower your stability suddenly, like tips funny and it's like much scarier I, I suspect. I think that's one of the problems I was having with like, the mental side of it was that I felt there was like no stability in that moment where you know, my hips were higher. Anyways.

05-interviewer
That's good. Well, give me a couple of years and hopefully once all this lockdown stuff is finished, and I can actually get in a lab and give you an answer.

05-participant
[unclear]

05-interviewer
So I think that will, will do for today. Thank you very much for your time.

05-participant
Of course.

05-interviewer
Much appreciated. I'll stop the recording. Is there anything else you wanted to just add? Or?

05-participant
I don't think so. I mean, I guess, like, news, like beating a dead horse, but if you can talk to like, women, when you're doing your study, I think it's an important part of like, having accurate data is like just as many people with as many different body types, you know, not just women, but you know, people were all sorts of shapes. I know they're hard to find, but [laughs]

05-interviewer
Yeah, I've tried to reach out to as many as I can.

05-participant
Yeah.

05-interviewer
If there's anyone that you know, that you think might be interested, please do pass the details on to them as well. But yeah, it is difficult, unfortunately.

05-participant
No, it is. I know, I'm like I'm always telling people like oh, like, you know, you shouldn't you should try to involve women. That's like, why don't you have any women coaches at this event? Because there aren't any. Like, I totally get it. But I have to, I have to recommend it anyways.

05-interviewer
Yeah. Absolutely. All right. Cool. I'll stop the recording in that case.
