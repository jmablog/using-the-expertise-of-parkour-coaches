Alright, so, as, as kind of was in the information sheet that I sent through, the study is about just kind of talking to parkour coaches about how they understand the Kong vault movement, just kind of picked that movement as a well known parkour movement. And I'm interested in in how the movement is understood, understood by coaches, given that Parkour is kind of like a decentralised sport, you know, there's not like a central organisation or rulebook or anything like that. It's just kind of grown up organically. And just seeing how how the move has kind of come to be understood without that kind of thing. So I guess the first thing I should check is, is Kong vault, a term, the term familiar to you? Or do you know the movement is something else?

03-participant
Yes, it is.

03-interviewer
Yeah. Is that the term you use to describe it, for classes and things? Or-

03-participant
Yeah, exactly. We use Kong, uh, the vault, it's not there. Mostly, we just say Kong. Yes. Usually just Kongs.

03-interviewer
Okay. You, so how would you just kind of, in your own words, just kind of describe the movement in general?

03-participant
Oh, that's a good question. I never describe the movements itself without showing it before. And so yeah, I would say you have more options to do it basically. In general, the only definition of the Kong itself, it would be that your hands are both placed at the mostly at the same time, and your feet are not going sideways, but through the hands. And that's it, if you do that, double kong, if you do kong pre, if you do kong cat, it all depends. But mostly the I think the only the only specific, like stuff, the kong has is this two hands at the same time. And the feet are going through. If you if you if you do split foot, or if you jump from the same feet at the same time, I don't care. It's still kong for me, depends what you like. And yeah, that's the only one I will say.

03-interviewer
So you mentioned like split foot and stuff. So that's various ways to take off the movement?

03-participant
Yes, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, because I mean, you can do even the Kong from you know, if you have like a stairs, you can do like one, two and then Kongs. If you have a running pre, and then dive Kongs, it's the same, it's still a Kong, different approach, I would say. And with the kid is the same, if if some kid is struggling with just jumping, you would give him a little bit easier variation. And I think split foot maybe is a little bit more complicated at the beginning to understand, which is which is really okay.

03-interviewer
Is that because of the kind of timing of the split foot?

03-participant
Yeah exactly, it can be confusing. Because when you split the feet and you put the both hands, sometimes the knee can go into the obstacle, or your body movement is like, not on point. And it's easier to work with someone who can kong in his own way, than in explaining the most complicated way of the Kong, which is not complicated, but at the beginning, or in the lower level it can be [laugh]

03-interviewer
Do you find it's like a difficult move for people to learn, in that case? Is it is it a complicated move itself?

03-participant
In, er, is it in, in like normal students? Or? I mean-

03-interviewer
Its kind of, I mean, it I know, it's difficult, because obviously, there's always gonna be edge cases, like individuals and yes, differences, but just kind of in general?

03-participant
Yeah. I would say with the kids its a little bit harder, because their legs are growing faster than the spine, which is hard for them afterwards to get the knees closer to the body and to get through the hands. But in general, if they will find this mobility and and like this pattern to get through the hands, it they really enjoy it. It's like, yeah, it's I would say, it's one of the basics, which takes some time to learn for sure. I would also say that you should, not you should, but it may take more time than other vaults. But for sure, it's one of the fundamentals that can that you can use afterwards, as I said before, in many variations like kong pre, Kong cat and so on. So I would say yes, it's easier to learn, it's easy to learn in itself levels.

03-interviewer
But you can progress it to more advanced things.

03-participant
Yeah, exactly. Like, like the pre, you can do a pre basically, from when you was born, let's say but on some higher levels or on the rails, it takes a little bit more time. Its like piano, etc, yes.

03-interviewer
You mentioned, you know, it being one of the basics or fundamental. Do you think it's quite an important parkour move to learn when they come to the sport?

03-participant
Yeah, I mean, it's, it's hard for me to say what's important for parkour. But I'm, I would say, it's, it's if you are, like training for some time, I would say, if you didn't learn it for now, I would ask what did you learn, then? Because it's one of the really first move you should consider. It's basically like, running forward, but using with hands, or like, it's, I don't know, if you didn't learn it. Yeah, after like one year of training, I would be really asking myself where your focus was, or focus on training was? Because it's, yeah, it's, I would be surprised if someone wouldn't know it after a few times.

03-interviewer
I guess, um, maybe the word important wasn't the best word to use. But like, is it, is it a really useful move for people to learn? Is it something that's really, you know, I guess, you used the word fundamental, like, it's a really useful movement? That is worth learning?

03-participant
Yeah, I would say, yeah, it's definitely worth learning. For sure. For sure, sure. Because it gives you some understanding how this this two hands works. If you don't learn it, at that point, you can struggle than the other levels. But if you don't want to learn for sure, for sure why not. There are more effective ways how to approach obstacles. But I would say it's the most powerful one with the distance, I guess, except of the running pre [unclear]

03-interviewer
So, I mean, when you say there are other more effective ways to approach the obstacle, do you mean in terms of like, faster to go over it or...?

03-participant
Yes, go faster or less energetic, erm, important, like, you know, you can just go around. [unclear]

03-interviewer
So what, what would make you choose to do a Kong vault then? If some other movements might be more effective, but what does it give you? That those other movements might not?

03-participant
My decision, that's all, mostly. But yeah, but yeah, if you want to do kong to cat leap, and I will choose a dash to cat leap, dash is way different. For sure. Because it needs my energy, way higher than the Kongs. If I want to do a step vault to cat leap, it takes more energy in just one hand, and it's a bit more harder, I would say. And it, the kong, yeah, that now I realise the Kong is one in which I'm really focused on, like, I'm not really going sideways, or like in speed or speed, step or step or whatever. The Kong is really straight, which makes me really see what's happening right now. And it's not making my body to go in one or the other way. So I think that's a big benefit of it. Even the dash is the same that you see are still our lean backwards, which is, which can be a little bit confusing for a while.

03-interviewer
So like that combination of being really straight, so you don't have to kind of bring yourself back to that after you've gone over the obstacle, is useful?

03-participant
Exactly, yeah. I would say it's very, very useful and pretty natural. I would say it looks like a cat move. I think even I think you in UK, they use catpass or something like that.

03-interviewer
Yeah, some some people do it. People alternate. Yeah.

03-participant
Yeah, I know the term but we don't use it. We just say kong.

03-interviewer
So you know, we we mentioned a little bit about takeoff and there's a couple different ways you can do it. Is it similar for the landing? Like you can come out of it and land or do whatever, a whole bunch of other ways?

03-participant
You can even fail the landing [laugh] For sure, yeah, you can do the pre so the legs are straight. You can do the split so you want to run fast, just like, pah, and run away. Yeah, for sure. And the same is applying with as intake of your body timing and position has to be also adapted in landing, if you want to run fast, you should be lean forward to get ready to run super fast. If you want to get the stick as good as possible, you should be leaned a little back so the power which is incoming to the landing is just kind of pushed you into the landing not over the landing. And you can do another like, like Kong to step vault, so you need to be already Kong and lean sideways. Which which the Kong allows you as well, you, you can go straight, but you can still go a little bit sideways. So it's very effective. And with the landing yeah, you have so many possibilities you can land to lache as well you can do whatever, cat leap, it's very, very easy to to change your directions. You saw people do kong fronts, Kong gainers, Kong, whatever, I don't know. You know, it's, it's, you have some limited stuff to do with it. But I would say with this, you can really play.

03-interviewer
Do you, do you think that kind of makes it stand out from some of the other vaults? And that gives you all these options? Or do you think that's just people could do that with anything?

03-participant
Yeah, it can be that it's it has so many like, like, it's not just the Kong, but the the specification with the two hands you mostly see in a lot of other movements. I would say it's more hyped that you that when you say for example, parkour, someone would already saw this one in comparison to other one, because it's very easy to remember. And it looks powerful. And yeah, it's you can make it as I said many ways, so it's easier to learn or easy to remember. And but for me, personally, I don't I don't level the vaults itself. For me, it's just another vault, just another approach how to use it, but it's maybe a little bit more effective. But it has some how it's called not benefits. But the other other way. Cons.

03-interviewer
Yeah? What would be the, what would be the cons?

03-participant
Yeah, that itself that you need so much energy, you don't mostly but even if you want to use it as as useful as possible, for example, like I am, I don't want to say drunk, but I want to use the smallest percentage of my energy as possible. I wouldn't choose the kong, it would be like on the on the far, far back mostly. And also, with the Kong, it's a little bit problem if you're one or the other hand is injured, or the wrist or if this happens, you are pretty much limited, which is in other vaults, except of I think dash, it's not a problem with step vault you can just go the other side, with  speed you can go the other side. So so so you need to be kind of fit for it. Yes.

03-interviewer
Yeah I can see that.

03-participant
Yes. And sometimes your hands can struggle the most I would say because it's so powerful if the the placement of your hands are on something which is like rough, like stone small stones or something, it can really easily destroy your hands and I don't know if how much you've pushed into it, but after a few strong or powerful tries, your hands are getting red and maybe swollen, I dunno. And it hurts sometimes.

03-interviewer
It's um, I mean, just because you mentioned push when you're going on to the obstacle, are the arms kind of pushing you off it as well or are they just kind of touching it as you go over?

03-participant
It really depends. I would say, it's pushing when I want to go far or up it's pulling when I want to go far or mostly down like for the.. yeah, it's very different and it just taps when I want to go get over so my ass is higher than my torso. Yeah, also different. The rail is way different story. Right. The rail is like, you know, like there is this thing if you go thumb down, thumb up, I always go thumb down. I'm like, all security.

03-interviewer
Yeah. Is that, um, with the rail just because you can't get the hand flat? You can't do the same push?

03-participant
You can but it's so risky.

03-interviewer
Right [laugh]

03-participant
You know, even if it's a flat rail, I would rather go like this. Because it's like, wow, I'm scared. Yeah.

03-interviewer
Quite small target to throw yourself at.

03-participant
Yeah, exactly. And it's so all so fast it's happening. So I will have my small thumbs to to get security done.

03-interviewer
Do you find that it's like a scary move in general? Or perhaps when people are learning it?

03-participant
In the beginning, you mean?

03-interviewer
Yeah, just, maybe scary is a bit of a strong word. But is it, is it more so than the other vaults?

03-participant
I know if they like, take more time to go for it?

03-interviewer
Yeah, I mean, or is it just like, people are a bit more cautious about it or intimidated? Or do you find that people are just fine with it?

03-participant
In comparison to other vaults?

03-interviewer
Yeah.

03-participant
I, I really don't know. To be fair. I, well, I didn't notice any like struggle, because mostly when we, when we teach it, we show them first how to get the hands on the obstacle and the feet on the obstacle. And from this point, we tell them yeah, we go on, we'll go on, we go on with, with other steps and so on. And, and then we show show them even sometimes before to do Kong on the ground, because if you can go like, like there is a line and you put feet, hands here and you can land here with feet, you are very fine with the Kong afterwards, because it teaches you, teaches you how to push and get over the point where your hands are placed. And after this point, when we showed the kids or the practitioners, this pattern, they are mostly okay. Like, you can always go a little bit sideways, we call it I think two hander, two hands. Like you put the two hands and the feet go around. Which is not the best approach. But it gives this mental block maybe a way for a while. Yeah, if they struggle too much, just, just do it. It's you still have to push you there is but do it time to time otherwise, you will not have this balance or something.

03-interviewer
Oh, switching sides?

03-participant
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Like with a speed. If you do speed or stuff too much on one side, it takes some, how's it called, it takes some some part of you, takes a price.

03-interviewer
So if you if you kind of break it down when you're coaching it quite well, quite a lot. It it doesn't end up being all that scary? Because people have got used to the movement before they have to do it on something.

03-participant
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they just go. They don't just go to the Kong like, okay, like, we will learn how to kong here. This is how you do it. Now do it. No, no, no, you can with some really, with the kids, they are really good in watching. So some, some of them can really repeat what you just did, which is amazing. But that's really a small, small part of it. And mostly, it's not how we do it, because they there is there is too much detail you should focus on. And yeah, and it's, as I said, if we, if we learn, if we teach it, the kids on the wooden obstacle, there is also risk and we don't want the kids to get hurt and so on. And so with the knees mostly, you know, like when you get the knees to your chest, it can hit the edge and it's it's, the things can go wrong.

03-interviewer
You mentioned earlier on that, you know, it's a movement that people kind of recognise outside of parkour as well.

03-participant
I would say yes.

03-interviewer
Do you think it's kind of quite like a almost a famous movement now by this point?

03-participant
Oh now? I'm not sure if now. I don't know what's famous now to be fair.

03-interviewer
I mean, I guess I'd say like, is it something that, yeah, like you say people outside of parkour will recognise it, as parkour.

03-participant
I will say yes. Because when you do commercials and when you do something like this, you want to see this Kong where where your body is not how you see it on the street, and the Kong is perfect, have it your feet are flying and your hands are like crazy stuff debacle. Even I think like [name] did like this double Kong over some cars. And many people saw it when you like, you know, like when you see some Red Bull athletes, and they want to do something which people are amazed from you just do Kong, the step vault they can do as well because, you know, it's more simple. The dash is too complicated. And it's not that powerful. It's maybe with something connected. The parkour is, parkour, I don't know, it's like, like some sport, which is not like violent, but which which has some power in it. Like to, but but to be to be clear the power of individual, both mentally and physically. Just shown in the movement, like you have so much control and so much power in the movement that when you look at it, you're like, wow, okay. Like, this guy now knows what to do.

03-interviewer
It's, it's impressive when you see it.

03-participant
Exactly, yeah. Impressive.

03-interviewer
Do you find that people like using the movement, because it looks impressive sometimes? Is it something that people want to put in videos and things?

03-participant
This, I don't know. I mean, when you look at if I would use term freerunner, they use Kong sometimes, as well as the parkour practitioners. But, um, just because it looks good, I wouldn't say it, because the Kong itself, it looks good, just from some angles. And in some, this aspect, like when you do kong pre, it looks great. But the kong itself if you do it, it just like okay, Kong, and if you do the video of yourself doing the parkour video, mostly seen by parkour athletes, and they know the Kong is not that difficult to learn, so they want to see some more. So I would say the Kong itself, you don't use because the Kong itself looks nice, but because you want to add something to the kong or after the kong.

03-interviewer
Right. Mm. I see what you mean.

03-participant
As I said before it, you have so many options with it. So it's maybe easier to do the Kong than something else.

03-interviewer
Mm. So you can, the movement itself might not be that impressive, but you can put it in some really impressive situations.

03-participant
Exactly. Yeah. Exactly. If it's the height, you know, like what [name] did, this Kong over the rail itself on the ground wouldn't be anything would be like, Oh, it's Kong on the ground. But because it's a drop, you are like, Oh, fuck, and it's a it's a rail and he slipped, you're like, Oh, Jesus Christ.

03-interviewer
And so I'm curious for yourself, where did you kind of learn the movement? Did you just like, teach yourself? Did you just experiment? Or were you taught by someone, you go to classes or anything like that?

03-participant
I taught myself. To be to be fair, we, I started like, in 2009, with my friends for one week than I had done. I didn't do it for four week-, for four more years. And then I saw the gym and I wanted to learn backflip, that's pretty much my backstory in a nutshell. But the first thing what, which I learned was the Kong actually, because it was very hyped in 2009. And so it was like something you always saw on the, the silhouette pictures of, you know, like, this, this guy flying. And so it was one of the first moves I learned. And then I learned the Kong to roll, like, you know, like you tap and the roll, because it's basically a dive roll. But it's easy. And again, impressive. Like, you're, it's nice thing.

03-interviewer
So did you did you just kind of see it in a video and try it? Or did you follow a tutorial or anything like that?

03-participant
No, I just saw it in the video. But when I wanted to, I already knew it, I already know how to do double Kong and so on. But afterwards, I watched like instruction videos or more with the speed step, and how to get the shoulders down from other athletes. Even though I did it myself time to time. I wanted to see the pros of other athletes to get maybe some some point I'm missing or something. Because I was struggling with the distance a lot. Like I was like, Why can't I do this kong pre? The other kids, other guys can do it and I can't. So what, what am I missing? And I wanted to find out so I was watching some tutorial videos and so on. And so.

03-interviewer
Did you figure out what what was missing?

03-participant
Yeah, the time that I put in, the practice, I would say.

03-interviewer
Oh really, so just a case of, just do more of it. And you'll get it.

03-participant
Yeah, at that point. I was like again 14 so my torso was shorter than my legs and so I was struggling as well, I was like, I was not doing this technique, you know, like, where you use the thumb, but I really had to push with my finger. And, and in general, I wasn't that powerful. It's all, you know, even though the kids when I see, you know, when I say kids, I mean, like, when I saw this be this new Storror in the UK, what their names? Motus Project I think?

03-interviewer
Ah yeah, yeah. Yeah.

03-participant
Yeah, they're like they were like young. And they could do big kongs, yeah, they were light and they were flying all around and I wasn't this kind of the kid, I was, I wasn't a fat kid or something I was just not powerful at all.

03-interviewer
So as you as, you've kind of continued practising and moved into coaching, have you had to, like, update your kind of understanding of the movement? Or if you've been able to just kind of coach it the same way you learned it? Or?

03-participant
Definitely no, I wouldn't coach it as I learned it. I would say at the beginning, I started to coach with someone next to me with the guy who already coached. But in general, I have always been because when you're in community, and so on, you want to kind of like, teach each other, always something. So you have some approach of explaining it to other persons, if, even though mostly are in the community, they're not always on the same level, but they understand the way how we explain this stuff. So the most, the hardest way was not, was to adapt to this younger generation level, like, you know, like in very small kids. But it wasn't that hard. It was just like, the most complicated, which wasn't, so it was really fine for me to switch to coaching. And, yeah, I just after time, I get more comfortable with what the kids can do. Because at the beginning, I was really trying to spot them all the time. And, but at the time, I was like, okay, they, they don't need that much spotting, they need spotting, but it's also for you very exhausting. Even though it's good that you spot the kid. I don't say you shouldn't spot the kid. But, but not all the time. Yeah, I was spotting them all the time. And it makes them maybe even for them, maybe it makes them too comfortable that someone is next to them. So you need to time to time, give them a little bit distance, like now it's a danger zone.

03-interviewer
And so do you with kind of coaching organisations that you're with now? Do you guys talk about how you teach movements to kids? Or is it kind of down to the individual coach, or...?

03-participant
Yeah, we, we, we had some meetings about how it's called, like the teaching programme basically forgot the name, like you have some period of time where you kind of train different levels. And then you have a break and then again, [unclear], we call it. I don't know the term in English. But and we also teach how to spot the kids with different different, like techniques. And so, you know, like backflip you, you support the pelvis and flip him over with the Kong view mostly on the sides, which prefers to you because that's what I said it's going straight forward. And you should focus on the arm and on the shoulder because that's where his head is very close to so when he's falling forward, you can like, you know, at least push him on the back, or like go with him. And yeah, we had like some time to talk with other coaches how we approach spotting, but mostly everyone has some idea of how to spot, sort of thing. And we mostly teach it on the soft mattresses so if you fall it's okay. You're not really crazy jackasses.

03-interviewer
And beyond even spotting are there like things that you are looking for in the Kong where you can kind of watch it and go, yeah, that was a good one, that was a bad one or anything like that. What what are you kind of looking forward to say this is this is a good movement or a bad movement?

03-participant
Yeah. At the point where the only thing which I'm looking at, at the beginning at the beginning, is if they use the thumb or not that the fundament for me to understand the first to not use the thumb, to get the full flat hand. Even though it never happened to me that the kid dislocated the thumb or something like that. But I would say that I'm very strict with full hand on the on the, on the obstacle. And afterwards I don't... I would say the landing afterwards. And the rest is, for me irrelevant. If the landing is like, you know, like, very good, like, on point. Not it doesn't need to be, you know, like, on the toes. And so, but if I see that he has the power to control the drop, it's okay. If he, if he lands on the heel, or she it's, it's bad. Yeah, yeah, that's it. That's it. The rest? If it's done correctly, you go straight through the hands. It's for me, okay, Kong, it's like a kong, it's a Kong.

03-interviewer
So as long as they don't, you know, come out, come out of it and just fall flat on their face. Yeah, they have control and they're upright and stuff.

03-participant
Exactly, exactly. I mean, it's hard for me to explain what do I see in a good Kong, because, you know, it's like, if you are angled for for for time, for me, I already see it's not the best Kong, but I wouldn't say it's bad Kong, it's a Kong, you you did it in the way you did it. But after what I focus on is really the the takeoff, it can be whatever, but the execution of the Kong, which is really just the hands on the ground and going through the hands, hands on, on a, you know, flat flat hands, going through the, through the hands with feet, and then landing correctly with control that, Oh, I'm focusing on that, because the rest is really allowed. You can have a head up, you know, you can do whatever, but just just do it with control.

03-interviewer
If, if you had someone who could do could do that well, are there's other things you might get them to do to try and like progress them that you would try and challenge them with the Kong vault. Like, try and go further or try and go faster?

03-participant
Yeah, after after time, for sure. But it depends, because if someone if we just started lesson and someone gets it very fast, I would give him extra rounds to really get it into his head. But yeah, after I will just throw the, but individual, not everyone but individual and say, okay, you can do like now a little bit more speed. Or you can try to take off more further or land a little bit more far as far as you can, even though if he lands on the heels, but he goes the distance. I'm like, okay, you try to work, because if you go the distance, you're really lean backward. So I mean, the heels are necessary, sometimes. So it's okay for me. Yeah. But of course, I will not push him into the massive Kong where he fell on the back end. So yeah, but yeah, the progression is specially important. Also, if you can play with it, like, sometimes if the kid is really good at it, and he's comfortable with the movement, we give him a movement before or afterwards. So he can connect it, which is another aspect. The kids are struggling with the flow. But that's that's another topic I would say.

03-interviewer
It's um, is the Kong vault good for that kind of flow to connect to other movements? Or is it harder to connect with movements?

03-participant
If you can control it? For sure. Yes. But at the beginning level, I wouldn't say so. Because if you land and you cannot jump straight, like plyometrics you cannot jump straight into the Kong, it looks sketchy. It looks very sketchy. And for the kids, they sometimes have to get into the straight line which is maybe also another disadvantage of the kong because you should be straight on the obstacle. Not straight on the obstacle but you want to get your body from the some angle to get the posture right. And yeah, that's what that was. I now realise we teach also the Kong a little bit sideways sometime. Like the obstacle is not like this. Like this, like going sideways because it's also kind of kong.

03-interviewer
So you know, you know always at like a perfect 90 degrees to the obstacle.

03-participant
Exactly. Yeah, you can go whatever degree which is, which is actually easier to learn this way because you're, you can push and your feet can go little bit behind you and sideways, which is [unclear]

03-interviewer
But as long as it's still that, like, two hands-

03-participant
Exactly.

03-interviewer
-feet together pattern.

03-participant
Yeah, yeah, two hands, but now they can be like, you know, like a bit adapted.

03-interviewer
It's, it's really curious because it's one of the things I'm kind of looking at with the study is how there's all these variations but people still know, it's a kong, you know?

03-participant
Yeah. Um.

03-interviewer
I just find that really interesting.

03-participant
I don't care, to be fair. How you call it, you can call it for me, you can call it even step vault I will be like, okay, right. I don't care. Okay. But mostly, mostly, you see, there's a Kong because there is nothing else to call it when you go like two hands and push even sideways. Or if you don't, that's why it does a kong. And mostly there, it's recognised as a kong.

03-interviewer
Yeah. Yeah, I find that really interesting. It's like, you know it when you see it, but you can't always necessarily say why.

03-participant
Yeah. Yeah, I will say if there is someone telling me it's not a Kong, it's a two hander. I will be like, okay, you keep it, I will keep mine I don't care. You know, like in France, if I would, I'm not sure enough to be fair, but in when I was in Serbia, they're using the French word like, saut de bra, saut de chat and so on. I was so confused. I was like, do saut de chat. I don't know what's that! And then I was like, Okay, well, I will try my best, but you have to go first. And then he did it. And I was like, okay, so that means a kong pre or something like that. Or as I said, catpass. If catpass if, if I didn't see the video where they use the term over and over again, I would be like, do a catpass. I was like, What? What, what cat?

03-interviewer
Yeah, I guess it's it's not so much about the actual, like individual labels. It's just like, a useful way to, like a shorthand way to kind of describe to someone like oh, that's that's the move you could try there.

03-participant
Yeah, exactly. It's like language. Yeah, you say? I say meco. So you say meat. You know, it's a language. It's a language. It can be different, in America, I don't know what they say. I think this is the same with a step vault and the speed step. What what, you know what, what it's like, with the speed step, I see the speed in the word, and you have to go fast. And but it's still one feet in one hand and the other feet is very true. So and we had a big discussion about it in our community, and I was like, Yeah, I don't know. Just use the one and I know what you mean.

03-interviewer
Yeah. I suppose most of the time, if some if, for whatever reason, like you say you're like, wait, I don't I'm not sure what you mean. Yeah, you can just show it to people. Right?

03-participant
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Because that's what's nice about parkour, you can go to China, you to people who are training, the parkour but they are totally not speaking English or some of your language. And you can just train together. That's the thing, like, like, you can point or you can just do the pre as well, even though it's yeah, it's weird, because there is a basically a silent guy. But yeah you, the movement itself, it's, I would say, as you say, at the beginning, the parkour itself isn't one organisation, but the most of the patterns are still there, like, you know, like English, German, and the languages are still the indo-European. And so I would say we are very the end, the Parkour is very young sport. So this would be old English and all the old Norse or old Germany. So it's still very young. And so the so the names are pretty much the same.

03-interviewer
So kind of coming back to coaching a little bit. You know, you mentioned you that you guys talk about teaching skills and just kind of share knowledge, I guess, with each other, about how to coach these things. Would it do you think it would be useful to have something that's like, a general resource for coaches to look to for like, this is a good way to coach the Kong vault or even just, you know, some safety tips, things like that? 

03-participant
Oh, uh. You mean like a source where they look at how to teach it?

03-interviewer
Yeah, I mean, just kind of, like I said, At the start, you know, there's no central rulebook or anything for parkour. Yeah, and that's good, you know? Yeah. But when it comes to coaching, you know, we need to make sure that people are being taught safely and effectively.

03-participant
Yeah.

03-interviewer
I'm curious how those two things kind of match up in your mind whether, whether we should have some more of that stuff or whether, you know, it's against some kind of against parkour to do that kind of thing?

03-participant
Okay. Yeah, I see. I mean, there are already books, not how to teach parkour. But for example, I think Max Henry had it. His, his book where he describes the movement. But, and there was even from Parkour One, or at Etre Fort one book with even illustrations of a jumps, it's very old, even the landing was like, not on point for me, but it was still a good landing. And I mean, from the book, what can you learn from the book, just theory, mostly, mostly, something which you can try to apply, but the best way I will say is to, maybe there are many tutorials on YouTube. So the best way would be, I think, for me, with this fundamental to, to do it yourself, at least to learn it, somehow. And maybe to get a partner who you can try to spot at. And maybe to have a little bit fun, like, Okay, I will do now something you will not expect and try to save me, you know, this, this, you know, fire trying, like you do a double Kong on one obstacle, and you want him to save you. And it really gives him some reflexes and maybe some idea what he should be checking. And as I said before, for example, I learned my technique in Serbia, how to spot for a kong, because they did on the camp instruction, like seminar workshop, how to, like, teach some fundamental movement, and mostly with this with vaults, like kong, speedstep, whatever the best is to get one hand, which is touching the obstacle, like, where your forearms and the shoulder, because that's very easy to manipulate the person with. You don't really like grab him, you're just like with him. If he's fine, you just let him go. If it's not fine, you will grab it.

03-interviewer
So kind of, um, yeah, experimentation and social, sharing, I guess, kind of knowledge and experiment playing and-

03-participant
Yeah, but but you would figure out it yourself. I mean, if you would try to spot someone doing Kong to grab his, not ass but like, you know, like, lower back. You wouldn't catch him? Because it's no fun. But but but you will find out okay, what, what gives me some time to get with him? It's the hand because it's like for a while on the on the obstacle. If he's doing a double Kong, of course, you have no idea? No way. You kind of have to find it yourself.

03-interviewer
So we've got through a lot of the kinds of questions I like to try and get through to with people. I guess. Is there anything about the Kong vault movement that you would like to know more about or that you're curious about? You feel like maybe you don't know, for yourself?

03-participant
What do you mean? Like-

03-interviewer
I'm just, I'm just kind of asking people if if there's anything, anything that they like, you know, I'd like to know more about this. Or maybe I'm not sure if this is working or effective, or... I mean, it's fine if the answer's no, as well [laugh]

03-participant
Yeah I'm just very confused... because, hmm. With, with, Kong if if, if I have some questions, about kong. Uh. Well, I have to think for a while.

03-interviewer
That's okay.

03-participant
For me, no, but in general. Huh.

03-interviewer
Don't worry if the answer is no, it's, it's fine.

03-participant
If it will be like straight instinct, answer it would be no, but but I'm trying to pull out some question which is maybe forced but Okay, I will go with no.

03-interviewer
Yeah, no, that's fine. That's absolutely fine. It's just because I'm kind of investigating this, investigate, makes it sound very serious. But because I'm talking to people about this stuff, you know, it's just seeing what what people might be curious about really? Yeah, [unclear]

03-participant
Oh wait, the people or me? Like other people or, I would be curious about it.

03-interviewer
Yeah, you.

03-participant
Ah okay, I'll say no, no.

03-interviewer
Okay, cool. Is there just kind of anything else that thats popped into your head or you thought of while we're doing this that you thought might be good to mention that didn't get a chance to or didn't come up? Anything else you want to add or throw in there?

03-participant
I don't know. Just when it's mostly for like, coach, coach, coaching people to coaching people, right? It is a question if this if this stuff is for, from coaches to coaches?

03-interviewer
Yeah, kind of. So it's, the whole study is just kind of about you know, how we've kind of come to understand these movements-

03-participant
Yeah, yeah.

03-interviewer
-organically.

03-participant
You're, but mostly like, asking the other coaches.

03-interviewer
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm talking to coaches.

03-participant
Yeah, and the result will be mostly public, then the mostly coaches will see it, right.

03-interviewer
Yeah, I mean, I hope to make it open. Just open access. Okay. So anyone could read it. But yeah, I mean, it might be more useful for coaches. And maybe, I don't know, but the idea is to just make it generally open access.

03-participant
Okay, yeah, that's fine. I dunno, with with coaching itself, I would just say try to enjoy as much as possible. I found out that I enjoyed it the first years. And after a while, it took a lot of time, which I did not want it. It was it's very time consuming. Even though I enjoy the kids, the kids were great. Even the grown ups were great, and so on. But it's very unique to get like the social boundness, which I am not the best at. I'm very, I would say I'm personally a little bit more introvert than extrovert and the, um, just be strict with the safety. But with the fun on the training, I will be more open. If the kids seems like or the practitioner seems like they don't enjoy it. Yeah. Just skip on. Move on. That's for me. Do you actually coach?

03-interviewer
I did, I haven't done for a couple years because I went to university, um, as an adult. But yeah, I used to coach with Parkour Generations in London.

03-participant
Oh right, nice.

03-interviewer
From 2012 to about 2017. So about five years or so.

03-participant
Five years. Yeah. That's a lot. Yeah. That's a great experience. Yeah, nice.

03-interviewer
Well, it doesn't feel like it sometimes. But when you say like, Oh, yeah, five years you go well yeah, that's quite a long time. Yeah, it's, it's good. I do miss it a little bit. But, you know, I'm doing doing this instead at the moment, which is nice.

03-participant
Yes. I mean, but basically, I would say everyone, it's maybe cliche in a movement area, like everyone is a practitioner, and also a student and the teacher, you know, even the kids between themselves they are teachers. I would say the role of a teacher is something else than a teaching actually, to be fair, I don't know how you see it. After the five years, I'm just teaching for three years, I would say, two, three years, I don't even know with some breaks, like now the corona, but I would say the teacher should be more like a part of the group than a teacher, as you see a teacher the word like in school, you know, you know, like, because it, I mean, I like person who explained the stuff, but not just because he's a teacher. If the kid is explaining, sometimes I give the people the opportunity to explain the movement, because they are just getting through the movement. He understood it, and now he has it in head, I have my experience time back, you know, like seven years of practising this fucking movement. And now I'm telling you, you know, it's like talking with some PhD, and you're just like, kindergarten kid, you know, the best way how to teach is the same level to push you kind of slowly. And the teacher should be there to just get this, you know, like with interviews, there is like opposition scan, you know, like the people who are talking and you are just there to, to put them in the right way. Pretty much. Yeah, that's my point of view.

03-interviewer
No, I like it. So one of the things that I found talking to people as well, is that you do have to kind of focus on the individual.

03-participant
Yeah.

03-interviewer
You can, you can coach for like general ideas, because they're probably going to help the most amount of people. But you, you can't ignore the individual and so you have to coach to them. So yeah, like you say, some people are going to are going to want that PhD level. Yeah, they're gonna want that straightaway. They're like yeah, give that, give me, give it to me, and some people are going to need you to just be there going, Okay, one hand, two hand and like going really slow.

03-participant
Yeah. Exactly.

03-interviewer
-Just have to adapt to that.

03-participant
That's right. That's right. And yeah, that I don't know how you did that. We sometimes separate them into the parts, which are like a little bit better and worse, which is not the best for the group.

03-interviewer
I think it's okay for some stuff, you know, if yeah, when it comes to safety, you know, sometimes you have to do that, just to make sure that people are being challenged appropriately. But it shouldn't be like the only thing you do. It's good to mix the crowd as well. Like you say, yeah, now-

03-participant
We, it's different approaches. Or I would say yeah. All over around the world, they will tell you for sure. Something similar, but for sure. Something different. I wonder I'm looking forward for the research.

03-interviewer
Okay, I'm gonna I'm gonna stop recording, because I think you know, we're kind of towards the end. So let me just...
