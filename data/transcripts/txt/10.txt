10-participant
But also, do you want like, is this for reference? Like, is this something where you're going to be coming back and going, Okay, this person said this? Or what? What's sort of like the use of these videos?

10-interviewer
So they get transcribed into text, and then I analyse the text for kind of themes, essentially. So what people say across the whole thing, what I can kind of draw out of the collective interviews, right? And then also, yeah, highlighting individual things that people say that I think are particularly interesting or make a point particularly well, okay, no. Yeah. And I don't think... you didn't request any anonymity on the form, but if you want your name left out or anything like that, then I can just say, yeah. Yeah, it's it's, essentially, it's just looking, so that the study is to look at how kind of parkour coaches in particular in this case, understand parkour movement, considering that it's kind of a decentralised sport, right? There's, it's kind of grown up quite organically, there's not like a central source of movement... truth for want of a better word like, yeah, it's and it's, it's also spread kind of, quite organically. It's not like one person is like, unless I'm like, MovNat where it's like one person has come up with this thing. And these are the movements in it, people come, have come along and added and subtracted, and improved and refined. So just kind of talking to people about some of that stuff, and seeing how parkour coaches think about the movement, and pass it on and coach it themselves as well. And I just picked the Kong vault as a fairly well known movement, kind of one that hasn't seemed to be widely looked at, in other studies, a huge amount, as well, yeah. And just as a way of kind of filling in the information for me as a researcher, before, I might start looking at it in any kind of lab environment, to make sure that anything I look at is actually reflective of how it's kind of viewed in the community. So the place I've been kind of starting with people really is just to check. You know, is the term Kong vault one that's familiar with you? Or do you do you know it as something else? Like, what's, what's your preferred term?

10-participant
That's actually, yeah, good question. I have always used the Kong vault, I've always said kong or the word Kong. However, I am starting to move away from saying that, I'm trying to actually say catpass more. And I think, because I hear, the wider community reference, a catpass, rather than a Kong. And I think you know, more people recognise catpass than kong. I'm also starting, to realise like catpass sounds more of like a description, whereas a Kong sort of sounds like a brand. Sort of like Kong tm. It's sort of like, so

10-interviewer
Like vacuum versus Hoover. That kind of thing.

10-participant
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So it's sort of like, so maybe it's a subconscious thing. But yeah no, I've always said Kong, but I'm trying to say catpass.

10-interviewer
Do you happen to know if that's the term you learnt the move with, you know, is that something you picked up? Or where you, where you first heard the term kong vault?

10-participant
Oh, yeah. I was always taught that this was a Kong vault. And I see, to be honest, it wasn't even called Kong or catpass. And, you know, when Steph created it, when Steph started with it, I have a feeling that when [name] started when he took it from Stephane, because they had a very close relationship. That's, yeah, a slight guess. But I think I would probably be about 70-80% sure, that's where it came from. And I obviously learned from [name].

10-interviewer
So I guess kind of a good place to start then is just in your own words to help just how would you kind of think about describing the movement itself?

10-participant
It depends who I'm talking to. So if I'm talking to someone like you, who wants like the technical term and understands biomechanics and shit, I would say that it's a hand first bilateral vault over over an obstacle. Yeah. So it's essentially your your, your arms are going first. And it would be very difficult. I can't quite think. I mean, there are there are other vaults, but not bilateral and not hands first. I mean, you've got like a front flip over the over the top. But so there are sort of like variations. But yeah, this really hands first bilateral movement. If I'm talking to other people, like beginners, and whatnot... It's kind of difficult to kind of explain in words, and this is why it's not very wise to just explain in words, you want to demonstrate it and sort of present it as well, so they can see it. But generally, it's sort of like trying to move over the wall in a straight line. Without any twisting. And yeah, like upper body first. And trying to get it to the point where it's not slowing you down. So that there's there's no no real, slowing down of the momentum, you're, you're actually able to increase momentum, and speed from using the vaults. So you're actually using the obstacle as sort of like a turbo boost as it was to kind of like get more power and more distance and whatnot. Yeah, that's how I describe it.

10-interviewer
And so a lot of these questions are obviously going to be very broad. And there's always going to be edge cases and individual bits, but just kind of what, what generally kind of obstacles might be used on or what uses might have, I guess.

10-participant
Yep. So common obstacles would be like, mid quad, to sort of like, just above bellybutton height. Walls, or, like, rails, or fences are things roughly about that height. Because of the nature of having to have your upper body lead. It's, it's gonna be very, very difficult to get your hands and upper body above that obstacle, because you've actually got get your hips above that obstacle, if it's any higher than that. So you know, you can imagine something that's at shoulder height, trying to get your hips up behind you that's higher than that wall. Yeah, it's going to be very difficult. So it's sort of like going to be a bit lower. Things again, can be very low. It especially if you're going downwards, but just like, generally, that's not really done because there are better ways like jumping on it, you know, because anything lower than quad height is, yeah, you can jump over it or yeah, yeah, whatnot. So and also sort of generating momentum and force downwards. Yeah, it's not quite as as good, having your hands first. And also, if you're leaning downwards and you're going downwards, you'll start to realise that the having hands and arms going first also means your head is going first, and you'll start to realise that unless you have very, very, very good technique, and you're very comfortable going headfirst, your arms are actually going to slow you down, they're going to stop the momentum, rather than speed you up to carry on going further if you're going downwards.

10-interviewer
So you mentioned the hips coming up. I mean, so in your, in your description of the vault, you know, you mentioned the upper body going first quite a bit, it what's happening with the, with the lower body?

10-participant
So essentially, you're trying to get, as I said, it's a bilateral movement, so both sides are doing the exact same thing, and your legs are gonna have to drive through between your hands. So as you're coming past the wall, both knees are gonna be coming up, and to get them up, or the whole leg up, you're, you're gonna have to jump, okay. And generally, the best way of trying to get that height is to get your hips up high. So as you as you're going forwards, you're jumping, to get the hips up, the higher, the better, to be quite honest. Even if you're going downwards, your hips are going to be high. And yeah, it anything sort of where you're sort of parallel, if you can get to parallel, then that's even going to that that'll be optimal jumping with your body behind you. And then then the difficult part is sort of timing, the legs coming through, as the hands are coming off, which is always the scary bit, because you're, as you're passing over the wall, you've done the jump, again, with your head forward. A little bit scary. But yeah, essentially, now the legs are coming through, as you're coming through that sort of like takeoff to mid, and then from sort of like midpoint of the vault to the landing of the vault. This is where things change. So it's sort of like, okay, hand, the first half is sort of like hands first, legs second, moving towards sort of trying to get as close to parallel as you can. And then as you sort of going past the midway point, you're then trying to drive the legs through. So actually, the legs are leading rather than the hands, unless you want to do that, unless that that is an alternative unless you want to go into like a dive roll, or something like that. But again, generally, you want the legs coming first, which means they have to be travelling faster, and you've got to be able to have the control of changing body position mid-flight.

10-interviewer
Is it- Is it the upper body on the obstacle that's kind of helping you get, changee that position in the air?

10-participant
Yes, so it's gonna be... it's your kind of like pre-loading the position from the jump. So as you push from the beginning, you're actually trying to get into the, into a position where actually the rotation of your body, so as you pull on the wall, you're actually bringing and driving the knees through first anyway. So it will be a combination of the jump behind you and the wall that's going to be positioning you for whatever landing you're trying to take. But you're, you're not going to be changing position, mid flight.

10-interviewer
So with the, with the kind of takeoff and landings, are they, are there particular ways of taking off and landing in the movement? Or perhaps perhaps takeoff first? Are there particular ways of taking off for the movement?

10-participant
I mean, again, you can, there's a scale, right? So there's like the most common down to, you know, very, very obscure, and, you know, starting with the most common, the very basic ones are two foot takeoff. And you start with trying to understand trajectory, and sort of the arcs that you're you're taking. But yeah, the takeoff can be two foot and then it one foot and then staggered, actually and they're two different things. One foot takeoff and a staggered takeoff are different and obviously different different sides. Yeah, there's going at angles and all that kind of thing. And it can become more and more weird. Running into it with more momentum, again changes the body position, and the trajectory. So yeah, all the all these things are different variables and can compound up into being very, very complex.

10-interviewer
Do they- Do they make a difference to the kind of midpoint of the movement on the obstacle? Or is it like the takeoff... It's kind of situational dependent. But once you're in the air, you know, you kind of approach the obstacles the same way, or do they, do they have an impact?

10-participant
They, they have an impact, they're different. You know, if you're, if you're taking a catpass from a standing position, and there's no run up, no nothing and you're doing a two foot standing catpass, your trajectory is going to be completely different. Like there's no way you can generate the same trajectory as a running one. Because the, you can't get the angle, right. So pretty much, you're going to go much higher, and come down the other side, that the arc of the trajectory will be much higher, which means your body position will be different because as you're trying to preempt the landing, you're going to have to do it much, much quicker and higher. Whereas one where you're running in, so you, for instance, in the standing position, you can't go high and then travel far, right, which is what the running one could do, like the running one, again, it would be very difficult to do the opposite. You can't run in and then just drop right behind the obstacle, because your trajectory is changing. And yeah, you wouldn't be able to do that very, very easily. And I dare say, somebody would probably be able to do it. But yeah, it's very hard to do that.

10-interviewer
And what about so like, landings or the other side of the obstacle? Is there a similar kind of variation?

10-participant
Yeah, so again, a lot of this stuff is environment dependent, right. So it really, really depends on, yeah, the the environment dictating what you do, and how you land and how you take off. So which, which is why Parkour is so great, right? Because you can do it for the whole of your life. And you can always do a different catpass, because you'll always have a different situation. That landing, again, depending on the person, so if you're starting off with somebody new, you want to eliminate any complexity, you want them just to get like the most simplest of landings, and that would be a stop. So you're just trying to get them to focus on the harder part, which would be the takeoff and the midpoint, but then they just land. And then you're sort of starting to work towards being able to continue, keep the momentum going from the 'in' part, and then sort of like trying to refine that so the amount of momentum and power that's coming in, is the amount that's coming out, you can keep going. And then potentially, you know of some people, you can actually generate more power, because as I said, you can use the obstacle to help you generate more power by pulling on it.

10-interviewer
It's, um. So you mentioned the pull there is that... So that's on the obstacle, with the hands kind of generating force like you say, is that like a technique thing or a strength thing? Is that something that is important to the movement?

10-participant
It is important, but again, it's dependent on the environment. So again, it depends what direction you're taking, and where you want to go. So if, for instance, you're on something high, and you're going downwards towards a landing, so that the wall is a bit lower than you and you're going toward the floor, then the pull would be very, very easy, because you're basically got gravity behind you and your hips are already above it. The only thing is you need to keep tucking, the hands are not going to be pushing you to go up high. Right? So you're not going to be slapping the wall to get height, you've already got the height, whereas the opposite, whereas if you're going upwards to something higher, you need to get height because you're already below the wall. So again, in that situation, you probably want to push up high to get that height so you can drive your legs through and get into a higher landing position.

10-interviewer
So one thing I'm really curious about with all this is, you know, mentioning a lot of variations and takeoff and landing and the obstacle itself. And this might be a bit of an abstract question, but kind of what what is the thing that then makes it a recognisable Kong vault? You know, if there's all these different variations, but yet we can, you know, we know from experience, we can look at someone and go, yeah, they just, they just konged over that obstacle. 

10-participant
Yeah.

10-interviewer
What, what's, you know, what might be kind of the thing that you put your finger on and go, that's why I've called that a Kong vault?

10-participant
Yeah, so it's kind of like it's kind of like calling a car, a car. Right? There are millions of different models, there are different many, many different colours and shapes and sizes, and, but they're all cars, right? And you can recognise a car regardless of the shape, and the colour and the size and everything. You know, a car is a car. And a motorbike is a motorbike. Because the way it functions and the way it behaves is different to the car. So with the Kong vault, yeah, there are very, there are many, many variations and people are always coming up with many variations, or different variations. But in essence, it just sort of boils back down to that very basic hands leading bilateral movement. Beyond that, you know, the there are edge cases where, you know, you might not really think is it a car? Is it a motorbike, you know, three a Three Wheeler, a motorbike, a tricycle? I don't know, there's always gonna be those little kind of edge cases. So for instance, actually, it's specifically there is [name]. I don't know if you know him. And yeah, so he, he does like, like, a lot of discussion about a hurdle, he does like a hurdle, kind of kong, catpass, where he is able to crunch up so far, that his sort of like feet and hands are over the wall at the same time, so it's sort of the people don't know whether he's doing a jump, or a catpass. And it's really on that edge of sort of like, well, was it one or the other? At the end of the day? Does it really matter? It you know, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. It's just movement, and people are always going to do differently. But in essence, you know, it's sort of like widely understood that. Yeah, it's just a bilateral movement. Hands go first, knees come through. That's pretty much it.

10-interviewer
It's interesting, you say about maybe getting too specific about is this a Kong or not, doesn't matter. Do you think it's like an important parkour movement for people to try and learn or...

10-participant
Not to begin with, no. At the end of the day, it comes down to the goal of the person, right, and importance is really down to the person. So you know, what one person may think is important, you get an old age pensioner, they don't give a crap about a Kong vault, right? They just want to maybe feel good moving again. Whereas, you know, you know, a young practitioner who's really fit and healthy and wants to be able to do everything. Maybe that's the only thing that they want to be able to do. And in fact, that that is a large case a lot of the time, you know, you've got people that go to spots, and all they ever want to do is the kind of cliched Kong cat or kong pre and the big ass jump and that's it. Because that's what is important to them. So, yeah, parkour... it's sort of, it's wise to separate the fact that parkour is not one definition. It's the person's definition of what Parkour is. And there is no guide, there is no like, this is what Parkour is. Because very, very frequently, it goes beyond those boundaries.

10-interviewer
I guess, important might have been a poor choice of words, for me, but I guess I meant, I mean, I agree for one thing, but yeah. Is it perhaps a useful movement to try and learn? And then whether someone you know, particularly likes it or not, is, is a different thing? Or, or Yeah, you know, feels a pull towards it, or whatever. But is it just a useful, a useful movement in general?

10-participant
Well, okay, so in the case of practicality, yes, that can be, it-... Yes, I would say it's not important, but it is very practical. And for the reasons of, when done correctly, there's very rarely you are able to do a vault, potentially a speed vault, or speed step might be able to do it. But there is no vault, where you can remain basically shoulder width, and do get across a an obstacle at speed and maintain that speed. So from a practicality stance, yes. It was very very handy.

10-interviewer
Sorry to jump in, just because I can't transcribe gestures. Do you mean kind of, like, staying front on, you know, not twisting in any way or...?

10-participant
Yeah, so you know, as I mentioned, the environment dictates what we can and can't, can't do. So sometimes, you might want to be able to get over an obstacle, but there are two posts between, er, to your left and your right. So you have to be able to, you know, get through that, while avoiding the posts. Now, the problem is, if you're doing a unilateral or a contralateral movement, you're you're basically going to be twisting, which is going to increase your physical width, and therefore making it very hard to keep momentum and speed. By doing a bilateral movement, like the catpass, you can maintain a thin profile between those posts, and basically keep momentum and speed. So yeah, it sounds like quite a niche, sort of situation, but it really isn't like it can happen, you know, because, again, takeoffs and landings and things like that are gonna dictate what you do, and they come up quite a lot.

10-interviewer
In terms of like, fitting into a route, is it particularly useful there as well? Is that I may have said... [unclear] I dunno. Is it-, so, that kind of description, very thorough description

10-participant
[laugh] Sorry [unclear]

10-interviewer
 No no, its great, it's what I want. Is it, is that something you've kind of developed for yourself over time? Or is it something you remember being taught? or a combination of both?

10-participant
Um, a bit of both. So, when, if we're talking specifically about me, I, it took me a long time to get it right. And I, from a coach perspective, seeing other students, it's one of those ones that does take a long time. Now, I can usually pinpoint the reasons for this. But there are sometimes some edge cases where sort of just the biomechanics of the person... you just can't work out why they're doing what they're doing. But generally, this is both for me and a lot of other students, the problem is twofold. Number one is trusting your arms to take your bodyweight while your hips are above the wall. So you're essentially in sort of like mid kicking up of a handstand position. Where you're sort of like leaning over on your hands, your shoulders are level with your hands. But now you're, you're kind of jumping up behind you. And a lot of people are worried because if they go a little bit too far, they're gonna feel like their head, they're going to go head first. And its, obviously it's very understandable, it's like something that we don't do very often, unless you're doing like a handstands and things. So kind of getting used to that is difficult. And that was always, you know, that was for me, as well. And the second thing is, and this is the one that I would say, catches most people, even those people that are able to do cat passes, is mobility, and just not having the mobility to get their knees to their chest, while keeping their hips high, and in that position with your head first. And basically, driving the legs through can be really hard. And just for clarity, I'm not talking about flexibility. So a lot of people can get into the flexible, can get into the position, but the mobility being that flexible position with your knees up to your chest, but with control and power. So, you know, you're you're able to get, you might be able to get your knee up sort of like, I don't know, belly button height, but can you actually get your knee up further than that? Without anything else helping it? It's sort of like, yeah, that being the difference.

10-interviewer
So is it, erm, do you find that people find it quite a scary move to learn? In general?

10-participant
Yeah, like, definitely more because of the first one than the second one. And also, because I think a lot of coaches, I'm not trying to pick on other coaches, but I just, I see it 90% of the time, they don't know how to break it down properly. So, you know, they don't, they can't think of a way of getting students used to those positions and starting to increase their mobility and the fear of leaning forwards. Yeah, it's quite tricky to get people into that position, and then feeling comfortable. So yes, it can be a hard thing to learn.

10-interviewer
Are there, erm. I mean, you mentioned some of the like, breaking it down and stuff, are the common ways you try and do that, or common coaching cues you give that you've found has helped people?

10-participant
Yep, there's definitely so that, there's... actually, this is something that I guess I'm quite proud of, is the fact that I have spent a long time you know, critical thinking, trying to figure out how to do this for the maximum number of people. And the prime problem that I see is the granularity of steps of changes between, like the most basic to going up are always too big. So you know, you can get someone because students become excited that they've managed to do something, they automatically want to go to the next step. But that next step is always a bit too big. And, you know, some of them get it, some of them don't, but generally, sort of a lot of other like, technicality goes out the window and they kind of suffer because they have to push way harder if they have to put momentum in or something like that. And yeah, that there's just too much of a change. What I tend to do is rein that back. So make, I always try and go okay, if this was version one and version two is up there is there like two little mini steps I can put in between that generally because quality of technique is the first thing that always goes out the window. And yeah, I much prefer people to do it at high quality rather than introducing more variables like speed and height and distance and all that stuff. So yeah, but ,do you want me to explain how I teach it?

10-interviewer
Yeah, anything you're happy to share is good.

10-participant
Okay, so like I said, the first thing is generally getting the hips high. And making the person realise whether they have good or bad mobility, right. So I always either I don't care how fit they are, or you know how able they are, what, and I even do this for warmups, I will always try to get them to start with a standing position, and both hands on the wall and jump behind them. So they're just trying to get their hips up high behind them. And that's it. When they do that, they're starting to, you know, get the feeling for that slight handstand position. And it's also showing them actually how high they're going to get their hips. Because if they can't get their hips high enough to then get their feet in, it's just not going to happen. So just practising that jump getting high would be step one, step two, would be marking how high their feet get up the wall. So as they jump and get their bum high, where on the wall, maybe brick, using bricks, as you know, visual kind of markers or something, you can see how close they're getting to the top edge. Third step would then be getting one foot on to that wall. So if they can jump up and get one foot on the wall, and then coming back down, that would be the next one. Fourth step, other foot, fifth step, would be then trying to get both feet on. Also, like getting one foot on, and then the other foot higher and higher and higher. So as they're jumping, they're kind of reducing the gap, sixth step both feet on. And at that point, I then try to explain to them that they don't want to keep the hands on the wall. So as their feet come on, they want to create space underneath them, and therefore taking their hands off. If they can't, if, again, that's a little bit of a tricky thing to kind of get in your head. So I will get them to do that on the floor. So sort of, I'll try to get them to do catpasses on the ground. Because on the ground, it's very hard to kind of have your hands flat on the ground and your feet under you at the same time. There's not a lot of space, but essentially, that's what you're going to be doing on the wall. So I try to kind of get that feeling of, okay, as your feet come in your hands come off practice on the floor, when they can do that-

10-interviewer
Sorry to interrupt, are the hands actively pushing them away from the floor in that case, or is it just, is it still in the jump?

10-participant
Kind of like a reflex sort of like it's sort of like, as because they don't have usually the mobility, it's as the legs come in the torso is pushed up anyway, from the hip. And therefore it's very difficult to kind of keep the hands on the ground unless you have very good mobility anyway. So then their hands on naturally come up. So there won't be a push, really. But that can come later.

10-interviewer
Okay. I have one more quick question. Sorry, that just popped into my head. So when you when you said about getting up with one foot than the other? Is that, um. What's the reason for just doing one foot at a time first? Is it less scary? Or is it easier mobility wise to build up?

10-participant
Yep, again, it's sort of trying to give them something as like, it's easier to get one foot up and two. So again, it's a halfway step between two feet and no feet, right? It means that their hips have to get a little bit higher. They're still practising getting those hips up high behind them. And yeah, they can usually twist a bit on to their dominant side just to make that room to get that foot on. But obviously that then becomes a bit more difficult on the off off side and the other leg. But yeah, it's like mid smaller steps between nothing and both. Okay. Where did I get to-... so two feet on the wall. Once they once they can get two feet on the wall. Then I generally put like marks on the top of the wall. So I'm going to start to move them further along the wall. Or sometimes it's good for like a bench or something where there's something very wide to land on, they can practice getting distance without having to worry about a landing position. Yeah, they just stand, they're just staying in sort of like the mid position. And then when they've comfortable getting, you know, distance, you know, a foot or more, they go over it. And then we start focusing on landing and sort of body position. And again, when you start with something big, and then you start kind of reducing that landing position and start making alternatives, I'm, I'm less worried about the landing position, and more more focused on the body position. As long as they're not like leaning backwards when they land. That's really the bit that I focus on trying to make sure that they're landing forwards rather than back and not with their hands behind them, hands in front of them.

10-interviewer
Why is that? Why is that for the body position?

10-participant
Because, again, if your body is behind you, your momentum is going backwards. And the idea of the catpass is to keep going forwards. And generally, you want to be leaning forwards, because if you're not, you're not going to be able to have a controlled landing, or keep the momentum going. Okay. And also, it's classified as a different vault.

10-interviewer
Right. Okay, and is it... do you find that some people can just rock up and get it straight away?

10-participant
Yep. All the time.

10-interviewer
Is that like a conf- confidence thing? Or is it, is it just purely individual? Just some people seem fine with it?

10-participant
Um, I think there were a lot of factors. Usually, people who are naturally, well not naturally but have, you know, more experience in sports, they're happy with their kind of, being able to kind of move their mobility is a bit better. And then, yeah, sometimes they just get it. So for instance, I, you know, I've had a couple of PTs recently, one of which was a guy who is actually on a TV show, quite a famous TV show. He's an actor, and he has done a lot of sports, because the production team have kind of told him, he's got to go and do these different things. So he's that, you know, he's done a wide variety of things like martial arts, and horse riding, and all this kind of stuff. So when I started teaching him parkour, he got it like, instantly, like, literally, session one, he'd never been parkour before, he was doing catpass to step to another catpass to a slide monkey on session one. So yeah, it was just like, some people just like pick up body movement, because they just feel that's naturally the way that they want to be able to move. And confidence. Yeah, that comes into it. By like, the structure, so sort of like lever lengths and things like that also come into it. So some people just naturally feel like, Oh, you know, I can, I can get through this much, much easier because their arm length maybe is a little bit longer. So they don't have to have as much mobility to get their legs through. Whereas some people might have like, tiny little arms and torso, but a long legs, you know, it all depends.

10-interviewer
Do you find that people come along to classes and whatnot, and and know what it is and want to learn it? Is it like a recognisable thing outside of parkour that people go, ah, yeah, I want to learn that, or do you find people have never heard of it before?

10-participant
Not, I think they recognise the shape, they recognise the movement a lot. But sort of a large proportion of people when they come to classes and things they, they they don't necessarily know the name, but yes, they recognise the movement.

10-interviewer
Is it, would you consider it like a kind of identifiably parkour movement? Is it done in anything else?

10-participant
Yeah, it's done in other things. It's done in gymnastics, for instance. And in fact, yeah, it's a it's a recognised vault on the pommel horse. But yeah, I guess from this is going down the route of social media, and youtube and the internet and whatnot. People see a lot more parkour videos and parkour in the mainstream than they do gymnastics. So, like, I guess popularised it. Yeah, the catpass is quite an iconic parkour move that a lot of more advanced practitioners put into their movements. So it's highlighted a lot more.

10-interviewer
Yeah, I always think when, when you see parkour in like film and TV and stuff, that seems to be the thing they go for to be like, yeah, this guy knows parkour.

10-participant
Yeah, yeah, definitely. I think it's because it's sort of like a big, much bigger, powerful move. It's something like if you if you're gonna pick one vault, that looks the most impressive. That's gonna be it, right? Because it's the one that can generate the most power you can get the most distance is very versatile. everybody kind of knows what it is. It's sort of like, yeah, fits in, like, ticks all the boxes, basically.

10-interviewer
I think as well, you said earlier, like, it's not something that people kind of, maybe naturally do in a lot of other walks of life. So when you see someone do it, it's you can go ah they've, it's not like someone doing a jump where you or I might be able to look at it and go ah that looked like a parkour jump, for most people it would just be a jump.

10-participant
Yeah. Yeah, it's definitely, definitely more than iconic parkour move that, yeah. I think it's just more from the internet, right? It's literally, you know, from popularity of obviously, the more high ability people are the ones that have their videos watched, right, so everybody watches those. And because the catpass is the one that is close to like the top end of vaults, it's sort of like, it can be very, very advanced in very difficult situations. That's the one that the advanced practitioners are going to use. And because everyone is watching their videos, it's like, Okay, well, it ain't gonna be step vaults, and it's gonna be Oh, my God, check out that guy's step vault, is like, well, I say that, but a lot of people are doing like speed steps nowadays. They look pretty damn cool, too. But yeah, Kong, Kong is usually the one catpass.

10-interviewer
Do you think maybe it gets up towards that kind of advanced thing because of the utility of it, or the aesthetic of it? Or...

10-participant
I think it's more the utility of it. Not, not the aesthetics. Yeah. Because... Yeah, no, I mean, it doesn't look that amazing. Like, if you broke it down, if you did, like a really, really basic one. Over a wall. Yeah, one side to the other, boom. It doesn't look like that great at all you know, but... I don't know, I don't know. Yeah. I really do think it's more utility and practicality than than aesthetics. Especially since yeah, that there are a lot of situations where yeah, you just can't do another move. Because can't there aren't any other movements that lend themselves to that specific scenario. Especially, you know, catpass, er, sorry, catpass to cat leaps are the ones that sort of like a lot of people see on videos, and I don't, I can't really think of another movement, where maybe a dash vault, potentially, but yeah, it's very tricky to do any other different move.

10-interviewer
Is it-... I'm curious sometimes, like, you know, a lot. A lot of the time you hear parkour described as like efficient movement as being stuff. Obviously, usually the most efficient thing would be to like jump on top of the wall and then jump off or something like that. So is it is there something about the Kong vault that I think you mentioned earlier about, you know, generating force that gives it gives it something beyond what might technically be the most efficient thing? Or is it just people like doing them?

10-participant
Sorry, I'm gonna sidesteps very slightly about the efficiency thing. I had a really good definition of the difference between parkour and, parkour and freerunning and it was basically that parkour people take the most efficient route the most inefficiently, and freerunners take the most inefficient no sorry, the other way around. So parkour people take the most inefficient route efficiently, and freerunners take the most inefficient, no efficient route, inefficiently.

10-interviewer
Okay [laugh]

10-participant
[laugh] Yeah, I quite like, like a freerunner basically go there to there, but they'll put so much shit in it. So inefficient, but a parkour, parkour, person will go, okay, we're gonna go there to, there to there, but we're going to take this huge, inefficient route to go get there. And I quite like that. I like that little definition. But, yeah, so getting back to your question. No, I think I think again, it's sort of like the practicality, it's the fact that you can translate any in- input force out and potentially generate more, which is what lends itself to being used quite a lot.

10-interviewer
Is it, is it just kind of a bit faster as well, to be able to just do a move straight over an obstacle rather than jump on top, jump down?

10-participant
No, not necessarily. I mean, arguably, hurdling, something, could be faster. And that, like, rough height, is something that a lot of people can and will do. But yet jumping over it. I mean, yeah, jumping over something over the same obstacle will not give you the right or give you the same trajectory. Right. So, you know, with with the catpass, the fact is, like I said that the hips are going to be up behind you, which means that they're gonna actually be a lot higher than if you jump over it or hurdled the same obstacle because the hips are going to be very close to the wall. And just that change in body position changes the trajectory. And it also means that the momentum is going to go in a different direction, or, yeah, whatever the arc will be. So I don't think, I don't think it's other moves can be faster. But yeah, I think that that's probably the one that's gonna be the fastest or, again, it depends on the situation. If there's a drop on the other side, well, yeah, jumping over it, and then just falling is probably, let gravity do its work, its going to be the fastest route [laugh]

10-interviewer
It's um, this has been one of the really interesting things about talking to people about this stuff is like we kind of discussed earlier with your metaphor for the car. It's, it seems like such a wide, situationally dependent, almost like a collection of various movements, that somehow all still are labelled Kong.

10-participant
Mm.

10-interviewer
Hmm. It's really interesting.

10-participant
Yeah, yeah. It's very cool. I mean, this this is why I think that this situation has come across because the, the definition is so loose, and has not really been clear, is not that clear. Um, is the beauty behind it, because people can go well, names really don't matter. To be honest, they they, you know, gives a fuck, you can call it whatever you want, right? But the definition is loose. So you just come up with what you want. And at the end of the day, if it works for you, it works for you. It's just so happens that there are some known ways of performing that particular vault in in a good way. And when I say good, I mean like, for the collective, most people will find the best way of getting over it in that particular way. But some people won't. Some people might find a different way. And it's about like I said, at the beginning the goal of the person and if they want to be able to do it, then yeah, well, there's loose definitions of what that is. And they might have a slightly different definition to what I have. But yeah.

10-interviewer
I guess the the thing that I find interesting about that is when it comes to coaching, obviously, if you're trying to teach someone something, you have to have a fairly concrete idea of what that thing is to pass it along.

10-participant
Mm. Yeah.

10-interviewer
But I liked what you said about kind of like the collective, you have, you have like a, almost like a generalised idea that you can adapt to the individual.

10-participant
Yeah, so it's sort of like I, I kind of see it as like, the bell curve of like, we are sort of like focusing on the middle 80%. Right. So the top and the bottom 10%. They might have their own definitions for things, and I know people that have their own definitions of all that stuff. But we're sort of like going, Okay, I know that the catpass can be performed in that really weird way. Or, you know, what, what not, but really, the majority of people are, want to get that middle kind of ground of, Okay, this is what most people do. And this is the thing that I want to be able to do. So that's what I'm gonna learn, right? And once they've got that, then yeah, they can, they can move up or down and sort of like go, Well, I want to try that version or that version. But really, you've got to have a sort of the base of the pyramid, as it were, you know, you've got to understand the fundamentals first, once you've got that, then you can start playing with the variables, then you can start adding more in and changing things. But you can't really do it from the top down. You can't go Okay, I'm going to, and it doesn't really make sense to do it that way. Right? There's no point in going right, I'm going to learn the I don't know, double catpass to front flip to cat leap. Right, you're not going to go out and go. I'm gonna learn that first. And then once I've got that, I'm going to go back to learning a catpass. It's like, well, what? Yeah, that does doesn't make sense. So yeah.

10-interviewer
Cool. I think I think that was kind of kind of good in terms of covering a lot of the areas that I like to get to with people. Is there anything else that's kind of popped into your head or the thought of that maybe we didn't get to or you think might be useful to add?

10-participant
Perhaps more just, like, on like, my, on a personal note, I think that we should have some general guidelines. Like, I'm very aware that parkour, as you've mentioned, has no guidelines, there is no rules, there is no definitions, you know, there might be something on Wikipedia, but you know, but everybody has, like their own ideas and their own variations and things. And as for coaching it, um. You're right, people have no kind of guidelines of what they should be teaching. And I find that's a problem. Because with, with a topic that can cause a lot of harm to people, you have a responsibility to protect anyone that you're you're teaching, right. And I think that the catpass is definitely one of the ones that I see that you know, very often as the one that hurts people the most, because they get taught incorrectly. And as I said that the granularity steps are usually too big. I've seen it so many times with even good coaches, that they it's kind of like this hope and pray sort of thing. I've taught you how to do the movement, you've done it on the ground. Now let's give you a box and pray that you get over it. It's a, it's sort of like, I don't like that. I don't, I just... there is a like you've got to have a little bit of it. But [unclear] at the time, it's way too much than what the coach puts in. And I strongly believe that if we can create all this is what I'm trying to do. You know, tutorials and sort of like, or maybe an established way of teaching something then a lot more coaches will go, Oh, shit, yeah, that's probably a much safer and better way of building up someone's progression. Because, you know, the, there's a standard way of doing it doesn't mean they have to follow it, but at least it gives them ideas of, oh, okay, you know, Polly, who's just come into their class for the first time is not going to stack it and basically, you know, never come back to the class again. Yeah, I definitely feel that we're missing that at the moment. And, and I think actually, a lot of sports do. So weirdly, I was actually thinking about this. Yesterday, I was sitting in Canada Water, and I was watching the skateboarders. And I was like, do they have coaches? The skateboarders, like, I'm sure that like the very high top end, skateboarders have coaches. But if you wanted to learn a trick, how, like, all I can see that they do is they just keep repeat, repeat, repeat until they get it. There is no breakdown, there is no kind of like someone has sat down and gone, okay, what are the component parts of this, maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm completely wrong. But I feel like there are certain sports, especially like, urban sports, the mentality is, just keep doing it until you've done it. You know, it's just like, grind away, keep hurting yourself, until you get that thing. And when you get that thing, you're gonna slowly, you know, understand how it works, and then you'll get it. And I don't know, that just doesn't work for me. So it's just like, nah, man, I get it, because that's how I've done a lot of learning that way. But we're smarter than that. And you know, it, I think that we can bring things like the catpass to people and more people will get it if they can see a structured path to learning it.

10-interviewer
Is, um... So I guess I kind of have two questions. Just to follow up from that. One is, you know, you've done coaching, qualification, parkour, coaching qualifications?

10-participant
Mm.

10-interviewer
Was that stuff part of those courses in any way? Or, like in terms of techniques? Or is it more about-

10-participant
[overlap] No.

10-interviewer
-general coaching knowledge and stuff like that?

10-participant
Yeah. So the parkour qualifications, which I helped create, as well, where, no, they're not about learning techniques. And, and then, and quite honestly, they shouldn't be, they shouldn't be about, okay, here's a skill. And we're going to just show you the ways of teaching that. No, that's not what a course should be about because quite honestly, that would go on for months [laugh] Very long course of like, every move and everything. No, it, the courses are much more about coaching. Well, the ones that I helped do were much more about the coaching skill, rather than the parkour skill. So it's sort of like, you know, how do you structure classes? How do you make sure everyone's safe? You know, how do you make them enjoyable? How do you develop people? You know, how do you keep engagement, all that kind of stuff, which, especially in parkour, is something a lot of people do not know. And they kind of understand the parkour, but they don't know how to run classes. Because it's two different different skills.

10-interviewer
I guess my question then is, so if you have someone who's becoming a parkour coach, you know, you've obviously thought a lot about breaking down the Kong vault movement, for example.

10-participant
Yep.

10-interviewer
Where would that coach kind of go for that information? Or is it just on them to develop that themselves?

10-participant
Right now? Yeah. And that's the problem. That's what the you know, that's what I'm saying that there is nothing out there that does break it all down and structures it and you know, and that's actually something that I want to change. You know, I'm trying to start to change that by putting at least some information out there to go, you know, whether some people agree or not, there's at least something there. But yeah, there's nothing that I know of that would go, for coaches, this, this is a good way of teaching this particular movement. Because I, you know, there are very few people that I actually think, even think about that stuff. So, you know, I kind of see. And I'm not, this is not me kind of picking on just parkour people, I'm picking on all coaches in all disciplines. I see there being sort of like two different groups of coaches, general, but one is the ones that parrot stuff. So it's just like, this is how I learnt. So this is just how I'm going to teach it. Right. This is what my instructor did. And this is, so therefore, I'm going to do it this way. And then there's the ones that actually critically think about it. They're like, why are we doing this? And is there a better way? And maybe the way that I learnt is probably not the best way, maybe there are better ways. And I'm always trying to push towards the second, you know, yes, I do things, obviously, because I've experienced that. I learned things that particular way. And I stick with it, because I actually do think they work. But I've thought about it. And and the problem is I think a lot of coaches come in, and they've not got anything to base their skills on other than what they were taught. So they parrot what they were taught. And, yeah, that leads to a problem. And then you see in all, you know, PTs, for instance, they don't have any experience in the things that they're teaching, and they're just parroting what they've been told. And that the kind of taking the human away from the learning, right? How can you it's like me... writing a book on the third trimester, trimester of birthing, its like, I have no experience of that. You know, who the fuck am I to write about birth? Right? It's sort of the same situation, it's sort of like, until you've experienced it until you've actually thought about it. Yeah, it whether you should be doing or not is like, a bit of an ethical question. I guess.

10-interviewer
Are there like, sources you draw on commonly for that kind of thinking about developing your coaching in that way? Or is it just personal experience, experimentation?

10-participant
A bit of everything. Yeah, there's, I do like to, I think this is more from my kind of IT background. I think because I see things quite linear, which is not always a good thing. I sort of see everything is like a problem and go, Okay, well, there's, there's, I'm good at highlighting the problem and going okay, there's the sticking point is the problem. And then sort of critically sit there staring into space thinking about, okay, how what would be the best way of like solving that problem, and try to kind of come up with as many attack points out of that solution. You know, how many things would break that down? And well, you know, why would that not work? And, if- Oh, and the other thing is, I try not to have an ego in those solutions. So I really, really try and go, I don't care whether I'm wrong. And in fact, I'd prefer to be wrong than right. And if I'm wrong, it just means I haven't got the solution yet. And if it doesn't work, then don't be ashamed to go okay, that's not working. Let's change it. And I think a lot of people can't get into that frame of mind. So they, you know, once they've done something, they've stuck with something, that's it, like they're gonna they're gonna be right. They don't, they don't want to be shown as being wrong or bad. And all that's doing is hurting everybody. So, yeah, you know, there's a lot of things that I have done in my training, that I fucking was so wrong. I was I was so wrong. Like, you know, there were huge parts that I'm just like, I was just being a fucking idiot. Um, but now, maybe as in my old age, I can see. You know, there's no point in doing that. That's just silly. Let's try something else. So I kind of pull in from lots of different sources and I always tend to go with... I don't give a fuck what Parkour is doing quite honestly, I don't care. I should stop swearing for your transcribing. By the way [laugh]

10-interviewer
It's all good.

10-participant
Parkour is just too young. Right? Parkour is just way too young, to, for us to know anything about anything. And I don't care what anybody really in Parkour is doing in terms of coaching. Because there was maybe one or two other coaches that I've seen that actually are okay. Yeah, they've really thought about it, like the the Danish guys definitely think about things, you know, deeply. And there's one or two that do. But really, it's better to go just way beyond what we do. And I tend to go, okay, who are the best athletes in the world? In the world? And who are their coaches? And what are they doing? And, trying to figure out who are, yeah, who, or who's doing the best in the world. I know, I'm never gonna get there. But it's sort of like setting your sights, you know, up there, at least I'm going to try, I've got some way to travel, rather than going, Oh, you know, who's the best in parkour at coaching? Is that my goal? Like, you know, it's sort of like, and the, you know, there's so much to learn, and so much to understand that, you know, it's just gonna be a never ending kind of learning curve. But, you know, that's the way it is.

10-interviewer
And just to just to kind of rewind a tiny bit, but yeah, talking about, you know, having those coaching guidelines and things for coaches. Is there, you know, is there a risk for that of kind of restricting parkour in any way, you know, that you've mentioned the kind of freedom and individual individuality that people can find in the sport?

10-participant
Yeah.

10-interviewer
Do those two things kind of contrast each other-

10-participant
[overlap] No I don't think-

10-interviewer
-or can they co-exist?

10-participant
No, no, not at all. You know, it's just free and well, not free information, but it's information. What you choose to do with that is up to you. It's not dictating anything, and it's not even, you know, you can't enforce that stuff. You know? So, no, it's, it's not at all. The, the problem is there just isn't anything. So everybody's just sort of like a bit free and wild and whatnot. And if, I always tend to think that quality is king, right, so if you actually bring good quality information, and it makes makes people think, and doesn't treat them like an idiot, then they might see the reason behind why you're doing what you're doing. And therefore, they, they will do it. If you just go Oh, you should do a catpass like this, because I say so. And you shouldn't do it any other way. Where's the logic in that, like, you know, maybe some people will do it. But yeah, it's just not going to last very long. Because people are going to start realising, well, that didn't work. And there's no reasoning behind it. You know, so, yeah, no, I don't I don't think the two are opposites as it were, yeah, both.

10-interviewer
It's more about putting stuff out there to help people learn or do it safely, but without restricting it.

10-participant
Yeah, totally. It's just basically going... Hey, guys, this is the definition of a car. How you build your car, you can you can do whatever you like. But, you know, we generally, community, the world considers a car has four wheels and whatnot, you know, it, whether you want to build a motorbike and call it a car, that's totally up to you. But this, this is the sort of like what we consider.

10-interviewer
Great. I think the sort of thing I've been kind of wrapping up with people with is just to ask, for your own curiosity, you know, what, what, maybe questions do you have about the kong vault or what things might you be interested in finding out about it that you don't know yet? If there's anything?

10-participant
What would I like to know about it? I think what you're doing, so sort of like the stuff that you're you're at, would be very interesting. Sort of, so generally, I get this is sort of like, most of the information about catpasses is I can figure out for myself and I have figured out for myself, and coaching it, basically, I can figure it out for myself. And really the only two things that I would like, or the two avenues that I kind of like to go down is are the any other methods of teaching or things that other people, other coaches have done, that, you know, I can then consider, and then analyse and go, Okay, I'm gonna try that. See if it works. If it does, then oh cool. Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna use that. So that's the first one. And second thing is like, the highly kind of technical, so the stuff that your doing. So it's sort of like, it would be very interesting, because it means that when you can kind of back things up with, not, not necessarily as like an argument, you know, because that that's the last thing I want to do is argue, you know, how to do something, but it would be nice to know, oh, well, on average 80% of people when they catpass, they do X, Y and Z, right? So it means that well, okay, if I know that, maybe that's the thing I can start off with, with the teaching. And if it doesn't work, then I can go to the other 20% of things, but it sort of allows me to kind of focus what I should be looking at. You know, if, if most if you start to figure out well, most people consider the landing the most difficult part, whereas I usually think that's the most easiest part to teach. If that is the case, then it's going to make me think oh, shit, well, maybe I should spend more time on that. You know, so. Yeah, that information on what you're doing? Yeah. Would be very handy to know. Cool.

10-interviewer
All right. I think that's everything. Yeah. Like I said, Is there anything else you want to just add at the end? I'll I'll stop the recording.

10-participant
Yeah, no, I think I think that's most of the shit that's in my brain [laugh]

10-interviewer
[laugh] Alright, I'll just stop the recording.
