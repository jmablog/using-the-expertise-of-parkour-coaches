Okay, there we go. So, yeah, so the study is just really looking to talk to parkour coaches about how they understand the movements that we do in parkour, how they've kind of learned it, how they coach it to others, given that, you know, Parkour is kind of a decentralised sport, there's not like one central place where everyone comes and learns it or something like that, kind of spread around the world. And I just picked Kong vault as quite a well known movement, you know, to start with, I guess the first thing to kind of check with you then is, is the term Kong familiar to you? Is that the term that you use to describe it?

08-participant
Yes. Yeah, we actually use Kong, cat and similar, things like that. But sometimes in English, sometimes it German, depends on who we're talking to.

08-interviewer
What, have you noticed any particular, when you it say depends on who you're talking to, anyone in particular uses one or the other? Or it's all just interchangable?

08-participant
Most of the time, people who train with other people from other countries, they say Kong vault, but people who only the train in Austria, and most of the time, most of the time, just say cat, or catpass. Because in German we just say katze. And that's pretty much the same movement.

08-interviewer
Right? Interesting. Is, um, how do you how do you spell that for the German? Because I've not heard it in German before.

08-participant
K, a, t, z, e.

08-interviewer
And is that just a cat? Or?

08-participant
Yes.

08-interviewer
That's cool. I've spoken to a whole bunch of people, and they've all you know, usually used one or the other, but it's tended to still be the English word, regardless of what, where they've got it from, like Kong and catpass, basically. So it's interesting to hear that in German, German, in Austria. So it's Austria, yeah?

08-participant
Yeah.

08-interviewer
That, actually, you just use a German word for it entirely. That's really cool. And like, just as a broad place to start, how would you describe the Kong or catpass?

08-participant
I would say it's a pretty basic movement to overcome an obstacle. Like you place your hands onto it, you push off the obstacle, then you fly over it, and just pass it.

08-interviewer
Is there any more detail? If you're going to break it down for like someone who you are coaching, how would you describe it?

08-participant
If I break it down there's different parts of the movement. First, you get the jump off with, in the beginning, we usually use the normal stance like two feet together, because it's easier. And then if you get there, you just use the split stance. So I have the right foot in front and left one a bit back. Then you have the arm swing and the dip, which happen at the same time, I would say, right after you get the stance, you get the dip and the arm swing onto the obstacle. And then you have to push off, and the pull, I would say, I usually separate into two parts. It's like you push off an obstacle and the same time you pull back so you can actually get your chest up and get a bit more distance over the obstacle. And then you have to normal phase in the air, where you're just preparing for the landing and trying to focus on the landing. Then you have your landing phase where you try to get your feet in front of you, you have your arms in the back and you have an upright posture. So you can spot the landing and then just stick it.

08-interviewer
Lots of good stuff in there. When you take it right back then to the beginning with the takeoff, you mentioned you know having a two foot pu-, two foot jump or a split step jump, split foot takeoff. How does, why would you use one or the other and how they kind of affect the movement?

08-participant
Usually when I tried to do quite far Kong vault, kong pre, I use a split stance which is I would say easier to get some distance in. If I try to do high Kong like high wall onto another high wall. Then try to do to use the punch stance, because you can get more energy into the ground, but it's a bit more demanding on the legs. And that's why we usually use a split stance because it's less less demanding. But it's a bit more technical, I would say. So you start with the hard one on the muscles, but easy on technique, then as we get better we change it up. So you get actually both.

08-interviewer
So does the split foot one, you mentioned it helps you get distance, so is it kind of easier to transfer to keep your horizontal speed?

08-participant
I would say so because if you use a split step, you can actually lean forward a bit more. And this you have more horizontal force which you can transfer into the jump, as the same as the dive roll, if you try to do the dive roll into the distance, you use a split stance and not a punch.

08-interviewer
So the punch with two feet, its kind of turning it a little bit more into a jump so you can get a bit more height rather than just kind of carrying you smoothly forward from your running?

08-participant
I would say so yes. Okay. Most of the time, in the beginning, it's easier, because people have some coordination problems with the arms and everything. And then we try to do it as easy as possible. That's why I tried to start with the easy leg variation, and change it up.

08-interviewer
So then moving on to you mentioned the arm swing and kind of happen at the same time. What are they? What are they doing? What are they contributing to the movement?

08-participant
I would say we have to get down on to roughly the same level as the wall. So we can actually push ourselves up. Because if you're too high, you can't use your arms, just touch it with your fingers. We use it to, you can actually get upright posture. Because if you go down, you come back up, you get an upright posture with your chest, and you have an easier time pushing yourself off the wall. And it's more like pre-stretching your muscles. And then you can actually use more force in the jump.

08-interviewer
So it's it's like any other jump really you go down to come back up with more power.

08-participant
Kinda like the counter movement jump because we get first go down and then come back up. So you can preload muscles get to stretch, stretch reflex and bounce out of it.

08-interviewer
And the arm swing, is that an important part, is that just something that people do?

08-participant
I think it adds a little bit of velocity into the horizontal plane. Because if you have your arms in front all time, you have hard time pushing yourself off. Because if you swing back and back, and then you come back forth, its the same pattern pairs with the legs, try to stretch it first, and then you come up.

08-interviewer
So the arms are coming behind you as you're running up, and then being swept forward-

08-participant
On the last step.

08-interviewer
-in front of you. On the last step.

08-participant
On the last step. So when you dip, have your arms back and then when you jump you get them in the front and then try to push and pull yourself over the wall.

08-interviewer
Okay. Are they, are they throwing your weight forward a little bit as well for the dive?

08-participant
Not completely in front of yourself, but more like onto the wall.

08-interviewer
Okay. And then pull and the push you talk about,o that's with the hands on the obstacle? And they're pushing, pushing first?

08-participant
Yes, so normally, I learned like you just push yourself off when you get all distance from your run up. But I noticed over the years that if I tried to do a pretty big Kong, usually try to pull a bit with the arms and helps with getting up. And I usually saw this also when some people tried to do Kong over rail. So they're not, they just don't push off they grab the rail, push and pull at the same time. And this way, they can get a bit more distance, a bit more upright.

08-interviewer
So that pull is is sweeping the arms back down. Almost the reverse of what we just talked about. They're coming back down to behind you almost to propel you forward off the obstacle a bit?

08-participant
Yes.

08-interviewer
Is that contributing a lot to the distance you get off the obstacle or just a bit?

08-participant
Just a little bit. I think it would contribute more to the posture features. Because if you pull yourself up, you have a better a time flying.

08-interviewer
So that that posture you're trying to get, I guess so as you've dived on to the obstacle, your chest has come down, you're trying to get yourself back upright in the air?

08-participant
Yeah. Because if you're too far forward, you have no space between yourself and the wall or not enough space to get the legs through. So you try and get yourself up, then you have your legs in front, and it's easier to get them in position for your landing.

08-interviewer
Okay. And so when it comes to landings, are there kind of particular ways that you're trying to land the movement, same as there's like, the various ways to takeoff that you talked about? Are there similar ways to learn?

08-participant
I would say it's pretty much the normal pre technique. So you try to land on the ball of your feet, trying to have your legs in front of yourself or in front of the hips. So when you land you still have some force, carrying you over to the landing, and trying to avoid your heel or your mid foot, so you don't crash into the wall, so that you have controlled landing technique.

08-interviewer
So that's landing with two feet together, coming to a stop?

08-participant
Normally, yes, if you want to stick it, if you want to continue, you don't lean back as much as you keep your posture more upright. So you have some forward momentum at landing. And you can continue with the movement.

08-interviewer
Do you ever land like on one foot or in other positions?

08-participant
Sometimes it kong straight, do a stride out of it, or flip maybe, like, if you land and trying to do webster straight out of it, you have to change up the chest posture and the landing technique quite a bit. But if you're talking about the normal kong pre, just have both feet in front of you, trying to stick it, if you're trying to do a stride you're to trying to get more of an upright, more body posture. So you don't crash down [unclear]

08-interviewer
I mean, it's interesting, you use the word normal. Because that's kind of the thing I'm talking to people about is like, there's a lot of things you can change. I mean, even in this, you know, there's multiple ways you can take off, you can land in different ways. What, what do you kind of think is it that makes something a Kong vault? What, when you can change so much to do, you know, I mean, what's kind of like the core of the movement?

08-participant
Um, I think it's important that you take off especially with two legs, but you can do it with one leg, you have... it kind of looks like the movement of a cat, when it passes something. So you have your arms in front of you, you prep, er, try to propel yourself over the wall, and try to land it. And the landing can vary depending on where you're landing, which surface, what you're doing afterwards. So I think important is the jump is with a, with everything forwards, arms on some obstacle, legs pass through, and then landing.

08-interviewer
So the kind of, the part on the obstacle is kind of the thing that you go that that's what makes it a kong. And the stuff around it kind of can change depending on the environment that you're in, or the goals of the person?

08-participant
Yes. Depending on what you want to do and what you want to accomplish. Because you can do a dive kong. There you have different jumping technique you can do. Even if you just do a kong, a wall, which is higher then you have to change up the jump and the run up, but the same patterns, always two hands on the wall, trying to push yourself off.

08-interviewer
Do you think that there's something unique or useful about that type of movement pattern? That means it's something that people like to use?

08-participant
I think some people like to compare to monkey style. Monkeys try to use it all the time. And I think it's one of the best ways to transfer force onto the wall or into the wall. So you lose, don't lose too much energy by travelling over it. Because sometimes if you try to use step through or something like that, you you can't get all the energy into the wall, because I think techniques quite hard to actually get a lot of the energy you have from the run up onto the wall to use it in a dash or speed step or something like that. I think the Kong is just this basic movement, which was, well, you quite, use quite a lot in the beginning of parkour. That's why everybody's trying to use it and perfect it. So it's like call it, um standard jump everybody wants to do, is just like a backflip. Everybody knows Okay, parkour, do backflips, parkour they're doing Kong vaults, is just a basic movement.

08-interviewer
Right, kind of quite a classic parkour movement, would you say? It's, is it something that, you know, you've kind of maybe already answered this, but it's something that people should, if they come to learn Parkour they should expect to learn to do this, or, it's kind of like a fundamental movement?

08-participant
I would say so because you can get quite a variation of this movement. And it's always good to have it in your repertoire. Because if you're trying to kong gainer, kong front, kong side, 360 Kongs, and stuff like that, you have always have to get have a good kong, otherwise, you will always lack the push and transfer over the wall. And you can't get the next trick out of it. Because even if you just want to do some flips, see sometimes need to do a kong over something to get to the next part of the line. And it's way better to have a good kong, because you get more energy more force out of it than doing a shitty Kong something or something.

08-interviewer
So that, that energy and force idea that you also mentioned before, is that helping you to keep your speed so that you're you're staying fast on the other side of the obstacle as well? Or is it about getting distance off the vault? What, what are you trying to keep your energy or produce force for?

08-participant
I would say if you tried to do a pretty far Kong, you have to use quite some force into the horizontal plane. And that you can generate with run. And then it's important that you have a good push off technique. Otherwise, you're too fast, and you might smash into the wall. That's when it's important to have a good push off. So you don't have to slow down on your run up. So you can actually use the run up as a way to generate force to get over the wall. And then do whatever you want to do after that.

08-interviewer
Compared to maybe some of the other vaults that we commonly use in parkour does it, does it have any like pros and cons? Are there stuff that its good for and stuff that its bad for?

08-participant
I would say it's not if you trying to do a flow line, it's not that useful, I would say there are other ways which like are more fluid like to step through or dash, they like more like, like a flow movement. But with the Kong, it's more like I would say power movement, or otherwise, because you always have to get yourself some distance over the wall. Because if you just get too close, but on the landing to the wall, you might get fling yourself back into the wall. With other movements, you don't have same problem because if you're doing a sped step, you have one arm, one leg on the wall and you just step down, if you're doing a dash, you're already over the wall after you push off. So there's no there's no hesitation for next movement I would say. And I would say the pros is like keeping yourself, keeping the pace and getting some distance in with less technical aspects.

08-interviewer
So with the flow movements, it gives you... it maybe has a little bit less control than the others because you have to, because of that power input? Or because you can stay in contact with the wall longer, than the other vaults?

08-participant
I wouldn't say it's a control thing. I'd rather say it's it's more of the space you need for the movement. Because if you look at some movements in which, a very small speed step, you just have the wall and a few centimetres off that. But if you're doing a kong, you need the space in front of the wall for the jump, you need the wall itself. And you need some space after that for the landing, because you won't have the time if you jump, you're trying to get close to the wall, doing a dash Kong combination or first kong and then dash down, so you can close to the wall. Otherwise, you might have to fly some distance that use a lot of space for this movement. So if you have a lot of space, that's good. But if you have a small area to train in, and we do some flow, when you have to kong and you already use half the space. It won't be, it won't look good I would say.

08-interviewer
How did you, how did you learn the movement for yourself? Were you self taught? Or do you go to classes or anything like that?

08-participant
I think about 11 years ago, I started parkour. And the beginning I took classes, and they taught it with this normal technique, you stand in front of the box, you have your hands on the box to jump. And when you're young, you push yourself up. So you get your feet onto the box, then you try it with a little bit of speed trying to do same thing again, jump, push off, land on the box. And with time you progress, get it a little bit more speed and push yourself over the wall. It's pretty much how I learned then I progressed from there.

08-interviewer
Where, who was running those classes, was it a group or just to a single coach?

08-participant
There were two coaches, and one of them was the a tricker and the other one was a freerunner. And both of them trained the basics with us. And then you if you want to flip or more tricking, you do with one of them. But the basics, both of them have them down. So no problem there.

08-interviewer
Could you give me their names or the name of the group if they had like a group name or anything?

08-participant
They had a group but the group split up a few years ago, but their name were get [name] and [name].

08-interviewer
Thank you. It's, it's just one of the things I'm looking at is, where people have learned from and seeing if they connect up, or if it's just kind of spread around. Cool. Did you, okay, so you were learning at  these classes, did you find it easy to learn or difficult to learn? How did you get on with it?

08-participant
I had some problems in the beginning because we're, in the beginning, the first movement, just jumping and pushing myself up onto the box wasn't that hard. But after that, just running on to the obstacle with more and more speed was a bit of a mental challenge. I think some kids still have this problem. When I teach it in some schools or something like that. There's some kids that will respond to it. And they'll just kong over it no problem. And other kids, they can't run up properly, because they have this mental barrier. And then I try to get the for, the run up as late as possible. Because you can get quite a bit of the push and the pull. If you have this down, the run up doesn't have to be that fast to get to get to have a good distance out of it. Then it becomes secondary, I would say then it's easier for these kids with these mental barriers to get over it.

08-interviewer
What do you think causes that mental barrier?

08-participant
I think it's this just running straight into something hard. Like if you have a brick wall or anything, it's just like you have to run up into something which is way harder than you and it can hurt you quite a bit.

08-interviewer
Do you find that with other vaults, though, or is it something that the kong vault in particular is more scary than the others?

08-participant
I think with this speed step I didn't have the same problem, but with the dash because if you get too long with the dash you just hit your butt on the on the edge of the wall. It doesn't feel that good.

08-interviewer
Yeah. So movements where you have to kind of jump at the wall a bit, and being in midair a little bit rather than always having like an arm or a leg in contact?

08-participant
Yes.

08-interviewer
Yeah, I was the same. The Kong was the scariest vault for me to learn when I was learning. I remember that. And how about now? Is it an easy movement for you now? Is it something you enjoy? Or is it still one that you find challenging or anything like that?

08-participant
Actually not, right now the Kong is my main movement, I would say, because if I'm finding challenges, most of them are kong challenges. And what helped quite a bit was doing really low kong like knee height kongs, because you don't have the same mental barrier. Because you just step over the wall if you don't make it. And you have quite a good technique challenge. Because if you want to get some distance out of it, you have to get the proper technique. Otherwise, you're just jumping over it and touching the wall. I think that helped quite a bit. Because when it came back to high walls, they felt way better. And they got much more distance with less. And right now I'm trying to do as many kongs as possible trying to get these big kong pres.

08-interviewer
So is that training your push and pull on those lower obstacles?

08-participant
I would say so yes.

08-interviewer
Rather than getting like a huge run up and getting all your power from that?

08-participant
Mmhmm. Because I was thinking if I get the proper technique on to, on the wall itself, the run up is just in addition to the force I can generate, because if I can maximise my technique on the wall, I have less risk of injury. And we can just get additional force out of the run up. So I don't have to rely on on the run up to get all my force out of it.

08-interviewer
So when you when you started to move into coaching, did you find that you had to change anything about how you understood the movement? Or update it? Or anything like that? Or are you teaching it now, kind of how you learned it back then?

08-participant
Sometimes it depends on the classes, if I have some kids, some kids which are doing the push pull by themselves without telling them, I don't have to coach it because they already doing it. But sometimes I see people which are just pushing, then have to mention it because they never learned it, might have learned the same way I did. When I started coaching, I try to think about the movements quite a lot. Because I wanted to see how it felt and trying to do trying to get the whole feeling back into training. So if I have something like this push pull, I would say if I do this, and then never tell the kids then some of them might feel it themselves. Some of them don't. So if I try to tell them alright, we're going to do it standing onto the floor. And they just push, they're landing between their hands. If I tried to like try to pull yourself in front of yourself and get your legs in front of your feet in front of the hands. Then you have the same technique on the wall and they have a much easier time getting it.

08-interviewer
Are there any any like common things that you look out for when people, when you're coaching people to say like Yes, that was a good Kong or that was a bad one? How you kind of assessing performance of it?

08-participant
Normally I would say if I see their hips rising quite high, so I have this like you u-shape in the air. That's not a normal kong or not a good one. I would say for normal pre because you get quite a lean forward and you might fall and I would say good kongs when they they look safe in the air. When you look at them, you watch them int he air and they just look safe and don't have this like arched position. Trying to not fall on the ass so it's usually depends on the person. If they look safe in the air, it's good. The rest, I would say style. If they have this, pointy toes or more forward, depends on the person.

08-interviewer
Does that kind of ability to assess it for safety just come from experience as a coach, just seeing what people do it and getting a feel for the movement?

08-participant
I would say so because some kids, they, they move different than others. And if you watch them move normally, and you think then there's something off, but there's nothing off, it just seems a bit off. And this usually transfers into other movements as well. And then you have to just, like, watch them, and try to get this, right, because sometimes they it looks off, but it's all fine. It's just their basic movements. So I would say if you watch them, and you learn, it's just experience.

08-interviewer
You mentioned about getting the hips too high. Getting the hips up high has been something that other people have mentioned, when I've talked to them about the movement. Is there like, do they have to come up some but you're saying if they come up too much, that's just as bad as not getting them up at all? Or do they need to, they, should they stay below a certain level or anything like that?

08-participant
It's, I would say in relation to your chest, if your hip gets really high, you just have to get the same height. So if you're just doing a kong if you're doing a double Kong its different, but if you're doing a normal Kong, and you have this parallel position for your chest to the floor, you have to be really flexible to get your feet in front of yourself. Because it's easier, I feel a bit more upwards posture because you don't have to be that flexible, and you have a better time landing, I would say you rise up with your hip and you can still come up with your chest. That's no problem at all. But if your hip comes up, and your chest stays down, you can either try to get your feet up,  and do a double Kong, or you can try to roll because if you come up like this, you have a your feet here, you stick it in then just fall forward.

08-interviewer
So they do need to rise up a bit, just you know, because you're coming up over an obstacle, but you don't want to get like right up into like a handstand kind of thing.

08-participant
As they can just do a kong front at that point, if they come up and just push like this to do kong front, it's easier.

08-interviewer
Is it, is it a movement that you found people like new, newcomers to classes or, for example, they already know what a Kong is, and they want to learn it? Or do they recognise it from outside of parkour?

08-participant
I think so, especially the kids, if they come to some classes, they've seen videos and stuff like that. And they always try to do a kong sometimes just get the legs beside but most of them try to a kong. They might not know the name, but they know the movement.

08-interviewer
Its funny, is it you know that they're trying to move out and stuff, is it a natural movement for people to learn do you think? Or is it something invented for parkour?

08-participant
I don't know actually, because it depends heavily on the person, some people they see to try to do it first time. Other people really have a hard time learning it. I think speed step is the best way more natural than a kong. And a kong is more like, it's more like an animal. It's not more like a human movement, but more like an animal move. That's why some people move alot have an easier time with it, because they already have some moving experience. But people don't move that much usually have a harder time learning, I would say.

08-interviewer
Is that from a coordination kind of point of view or strength, or both?

08-participant
I would say it's more like coordination and mental. Because I would say almost everybody has the power to push themselves off a wall. I had some people around the 100 kilogrammes which were able to do a kong vault so if you have kids, there shouldn't be any problem with the power or with to force.

08-interviewer
Does strength play any role in the movement, like if you're stronger, can you perform it easier or go further or anything like that?

08-participant
Yeah.

08-interviewer
Or is it mostly a technique thing?

08-participant
I would say if you have more power in your arms, if you're strong in your arms, it's easier because you, you know, you can push yourself off the wall, and you get more distance between yourself to walk in the wall. So you don't have to rely on technique too much to get your feet over the wall. But I would say it's easier to get the technique down and then get the strength. But if you have the strength already, it's easier to learn because you can push yourself up quite hard, then it's easier to get over the wall.

08-interviewer
I realised actually, I never asked right back in the beginning. What, what kind of obstacles is it used on? Are there things it's particularly well suited for? I know, it's quite a broad question. You know, like, I know, it can be used in all sorts of weird things in parkour, but are there like common common uses for it, common things it's used on?

08-participant
I would say, the normal kong is performed on the, on a wall, which is about two hands wide. So you don't have to worry about too much about the hand placement. Normally, if you see a pretty big kong, it's about, it's done over a wall. Rail kongs are common too, but they're way harder, because you have to grab the rail, it's easier, it's more risky. And usually just do it over one and try to land on another one or something like that.

08-interviewer
Are rails just riskier, just because there are a smaller surface, you're just more likely to miss it?

08-participant
Mmhmm. Harder to get it the technique down or not the technique, but more like the coordination, when you actually trt to grab it. Because you have a wall, you have more space, you just slap your heads onto it. And if it's not a really small wall, you're gonna hit it. So you don't have to worry about too much about missing hands.

08-interviewer
And with rails, you know, you can't presumably get the hand flat on top either. Does that change the movement as well, like the push and pull that you mentioned?

08-participant
I would say just a bit, but more like a feeling change. The technique itself won't change too much just a bit. Because you actually grab the rail, I would say, because most people try to grab it. So you get to get them by grabbing it. You can't push yourself off as fast as off a wall. So you actually have to have a little less speed on to it. Because you have you need more time to get yourself over the rail than over the wall.

08-interviewer
Are they, as well as being more technically challenging on a rail. Are they scarier as a result?

08-participant
Yes. Yes.

Okay, so coming back to coaching a little bit. You know, so you're your coach with ATG parkour? Is that right?

08-participant
Oh, yeah.

08-interviewer
Yeah.

08-participant
ATG is more like it's like a, I don't know, the English word for it, but it's different sports under one organisation. So you have like, different trainers for different sports, running, gymnastics, water sports, track and field and there's one part which is parkour.

08-interviewer
Okay.

08-participant
So, ATG is for [unclear], which is just a general movement organisation, I would say.

08-interviewer
Oh, interesting. That's cool. I was gonna ask then, do you... are there other parkour coaches as part of that as well? Or is it just you?

08-participant
Um, there was another one, which was teaching as well, but he got too busy with work. So he had to stop doing the classes and I over took, now I'm teaching his class too.

08-interviewer
The thing I'm curious about is whether when coaches work in like, organisations or groups, whether they talk about how they coach the skills or whether there's like an agreed agreement on how they're going to coach you, or whether it's just all down to the individual coach and their experience. So I don't know if you if that's something you used to do, or you do now, but with coaches from other sports, do you talk about coaching and how you do it?

08-participant
Sometimes I talk to the gymnast, gymnastics coach, because we have quite a few of them, and some track and field coaches and stuff like that. Because they sometimes have quite similar movements. And they tried to teach and try to teach in a quite similar way, just with a little twist specific to their own sport. And you can always learn something from them. You don't have to take the complete concept and teach it like this. But you can always get something from them. Right now we're trying to make our own little parkour organisation, I would say, there are like five or six trainers in there. And we're talking about how we teach something, and why we think it's good to teach it like this. Because we might have some difference in approach, because if I teach a backflip different to someone else, we talk about it and he says, like, I have good experience with going over the shoulder. I say I never tried it that way. And then we try to get best, the best of both worlds. Try to complete like combined, and it's the same for the Kong.

08-interviewer
Have you found with the Kong vault in particular that there have been differences in approach or do people tend to teach it the same way?

08-participant
The main problem here  in my city is most of the people have learned from the same five to six people. So it's pretty much the same. That's the same as Austria because we have a few people who started like 15 years ago, they started the first trainer courses and they learned from them from there and spread so it's pretty much the same in Austria.

08-interviewer
Okay, that's really interesting. How about you know, I've seen you've got the parkour UK level one qualification?

08-participant
Um, no, I have something different. Have you talked to someone else from Austria?

08-interviewer
Uhh... yes, you're right. I've written that down for the wrong person. You've got the BSPA instructor?

08-participant
Yes, BSPAs are, like it's a nation wide organisation which is responsible for training courses and training classes, for different sports, there are like big organisation, they have different people for different sports. And then you have the different levels of coaches. With the beginning. It's like an instructor, it's the lowest level, no [unclear], which is the lowest level then you have the instructor then you have the trainer and then I dunno, [unclear], I don't know if the same word because you have...

08-interviewer
Like a master trainer or something like that?

08-participant
Yeah, something like that. It's on the same level as master's degree in sports science.

08-interviewer
Oh, wow.

08-participant
They have the different levels. They have the instructor right now, and trying to get a trainer course for parkour, which is on the same level as the bachelor bachelor's degree of sports science I would say.

08-interviewer
Wow, cool. That's cool. I don't think I've heard of a parkour specific qualification at that level. yet. I think that's the first one I've heard about.

08-participant
Because here some people are actually quite motivated to get the sport going in Austria. Maybe you know one of them. [name]?

08-interviewer
Oh yes. I don't know her but I know the name. Yeah.

08-participant
Because she's very motivated and trying to get these courses running so more people can get some qualification and actually know what they're teaching. Because there are a lot of people in Austria who are teaching parkour and never done parkour. We have like, five or six courses and only two people of them have some qualifications, all the other people are like ah I saw it on the internet. Or are ex-gymnastics, trying to teach it.

08-interviewer
So I'm really curious with the instructor qualification, then did that include, you know, this is how you teach a Kong vault, or this is what a Kong vault is, was that in the course, or was it just like expected that you'd know that from your own background?

08-participant
It wasn't expected, it was in the part before in the [unclear], which is the primary or the base. And then you in the instructor you have more like, a bit more challenging moves like variations of the common flips. And you have basic strength training, stuff like that, how to increase the strength specific for parkour and stuff like that. Overall, and the specific part for the course.

08-interviewer
So was that actually teaching you how to do the movement or how to coach the movement?

08-participant
Its, normally, you have an entrance exam. So you have to know how to do it yourself. The movements, which is just a physical examination, I would say, you come there, they're like, ah, do this, this and this, and you do the things. And they're like, good, you're good to go. And then you get to, you get taught how to teach it. Because you have to do have some level of skill, but they teach you how to teach it.

08-interviewer
Were you already coaching before you took the qualification? Or do you do the qualification first and then start coaching?

08-participant
I was teaching beforehand.

08-interviewer
And how's it-

08-participant
If there's like-

08-interviewer
Sorry.

08-participant
And I just wanted to say, because my old trainer, he taught me how to teach these things, and how to spot them. And then after he stopped doing courses, I just overtook them for him and started this.

08-interviewer
And how did you find like, your own experience and the stuff he developed or the stuff you learned from your trainer before, for teaching the Kong vault, how did that compare to the stuff being taught in the course? Was it very similar? Or did you find this very different?

08-participant
It was pretty much the same, because the guy who was the teacher there was the same teacher for my trainer. But it wasn't, it was a bit more developed, because there was like a time period of five to six years between these two courses. And that's in the beginning was more like this hero movement, you just push yourself off, you fly and the land. With time, they learn new things, and they adapted it in their courses.

08-interviewer
This is kind of over time become a bit more refined rather than changed completely.

08-participant
Yes. I would say it's the same as for strength training parkour. Years go, nobody was doing it. Except for some pros. And I've seen some changes now, especially with [names] and people like that. We're trying to get the idea of parkour specific strength training to the people. So more and more people starting, I would say it's the same because a few years ago was like, You lift heavy, you can better, that's it. And now you have more and more information about why you lift heavy, why you sometimes lift, not too heavy, and you still get better.

08-interviewer
That's really interesting. I didn't realise that the BSPA thing that you mentioned in the form when you filled it out was was to that kind of.. yeah, that kind of level going right up to to degree kind of level instruction in parkour specifically. That's really interesting.

08-participant
For parkour right now, there isn't the highest education level available, because they're not enough money. Not enough people right now for this course. So we are right now with instructor and there's this trainer course which is, which is being planned right now. And I think it should start next year or something like that, or an end of this year, if there are enough participants, because the last level is for coaches who are already coaching international team like Olympics for swimming and stuff like that. That's like the highest level you can get in Austria. That's for the experts.

08-interviewer
Wow, that's great. Are you involved in putting the courses together? Or are you taking, just taking them as a student?

08-participant
Right now I'm just taking them at the [unclear]. But for few friends of mine, I do the strength training. And I try to always tell them how I do something. And why do it like that. Because the same is true. If I tell them I do it like this, the Kong? And I tell them why. Most of the time they understand, or if they don't understand or don't agree with it, they tell me why they don't agree then we try to come up with a solution.

08-interviewer
That's pretty cool. Okay, sorry, I went off on a little bit of a side topic there. That's really cool. So the, you know, we've covered a lot of the points, I like to try and hit with people. Are there, are there any things about the Kong vault that you're curious about, that you want to know more about for yourself? And it's, it's okay, if the answer is no, as well by the way. I don't want to put you on the spot.

08-participant
I would say it's a lot about the small part over the wall, because the run up and the landing are quite clear, I would say. But sometimes the people who are still teaching like you just push yourself off and the fly. But what about push and try to pull? What is your chest doing? What is their spine doing, what are their legs doing? I think that's an important part, which isn't covered completely yet. So would you be nice to have some more information about that. This short period of time over the wall. What are you doing there? And why are some people better there than others?

08-interviewer
The kind of what the hands are doing, on the obstacle in the movement?

08-participant
It's like, the whole body, what's it doing over the wall.

08-interviewer
Yeah. Is there, is there anything else that you know, you've thought of or might have popped into your head during the conversation that we haven't had a chance to talk about or we didn't get to, that you'd like to add?

08-participant
Right now the only question I'm having is, how to incorporate strength training to improve your kong vault? Because it's pretty easy, like do push ups or bench press stuff like that. But what about the back? Are they doing especially, especially for the lats, something like that, to get your pull? I think that would be nice to know, if you have some exercises of stuff like that.

08-interviewer
It'd be quite interesting to see whether, you know, you could correlate someone's back strength, or something. like how and how many pull ups they could do or how much weight they could do and how far they could travel off the kong vault. Something like that.

08-participant
Maybe something different, because I think the main problem with the pull up, you have to move on from here to here and with the Kong you have it down here, just maybe lat pulldown from from the shoulders down.

08-interviewer
Yeah, kind of straight arm stuff or even something like a lever.

08-participant
Yeah.

08-interviewer
Interesting. Okay. Well, yeah, otherwise, you know, like I say, we've gone through all the points I'd like to try and get to people. Yeah, unless there's anything else you want to add. Then I'll stop the recording. And we can we can wrap up.

08-participant
I think I don't have anything more to say right now.

08-interviewer
Okay, great. Let me just stop the recording.
