07-participant
Gotcha.

07-interviewer
All right, there we go. So, yeah, so the study is just kind of looking to talk to parkour coaches and practitioners out there and talk about some of the movements that that we do. And how people understand them, how they learnt them, how they coach them themselves, with a view to kind of understand these things for a, like a decentralised sport like parkour is, you know, there's not like a central organisation or rulebook, or it's just kind of organically grown over time. So it's just kind of seeing how, although it's spread, organically seeing how people kind of understand these movements that have become kind of known parkour movements. And so I just picked the Kong vault, as like kind of a well known movement to start with just to kind of start exploring these things. But I guess in that case, the first thing to kind of ask you is, is that the term that you're familiar with, Kong vault, or do you know it as something else or...?

07-participant
I would say that generally, um, the Kong vault would be the overall like, most common term that people use, but I've also heard an awful lot of catpass. And back when I started, you know, in 2011, 2012, some people were calling it a monkey vault at that time. But I would say the general consensus is that Kong is the most widely understood term for the technique that we're discussing.

07-interviewer
Do you know, do you know how that term came about? Just out of curiosity?

07-participant
Um, I don't know, specifically, but you know, if I had to guess it kind of looks like Donkey Kong, you know, the way that he would just move around in the video game. So it's a it's a fitting name.

07-interviewer
So is that is that the term you'd use for coaching and whatnot?

07-participant
Yes, I would use Kong vault.

07-interviewer
And how, I know, obviously, these things tend to be very visual, especially in coaching, you know, we tend to demonstrate stuff, but how would you describe the movement, just?

07-participant
Alright, so I would definitely describe it during class through demonstration. But I would say that it is a symmetrical vault where you place both hands on the object and your body moves through that the plane between your two hands.

07-interviewer
Okay. And if you, er, if you ertr going to kind of try and break it down into into maybe stages or, you know, give a bit more detail about the movement, are there, how would, how would you kind of describe it further I guess.

07-participant
Sure. So the first stage is the run up. And when you begin running up into a kong, it's going to be different than a sprint, or even a long jump approach. It's going to be as you're running, you continue to lower your body so that, like you do it gradually, I would not recommend, you know, starting upright and then going down, but you kind of as you're running, you gradually lower yourself so that you're in the prime position to take off. As you're doing that, you want to be at a low point when you get into your penultimate and final step, which are going to ultimately determine your trajectory and how much power you're going to get for the kong. During those two steps. You, um, on the third to last step, you're going to take a long stride, gaining into your second to last step, and then quickly go right into your final step. So you're it's almost like a plyo takeoff, except your feet are split. So you could even call it a gallop. For the for the final step and the takeoff, your arms are back as you're in that gallop position, your chest is low. And as you take off, you want to reach with your arms while raising your hips simultaneously. That's actually a technique that I learned pretty recently, um, I've noticed that like, if you get your hips higher, then there's less distance that your centre of mass has to travel over the wall. So if from that position, it's just easier to go further. So you want to you want to have that form. You want to make sure that you're taking off nice and far from the wall when you do that, so you have space for your legs to clear and carry through. From there now you're at takeoff. You want to pull your arms back, you know as you push off the wall, allow your chest to rise point with the toes while watching for your landing to prepare for whatever you're going to do out of it, be it a stick, a safety out, dash.

07-interviewer
So can you do it with other types of takeoff as well?

07-participant
So you can do a Kong vault from a purely two footed, like stance, a lot of the time, people will do standing dive kongs, and even standing kong precisions. And it does work. But with momentum, doing that punch footed takeoff is gonna, you know, decrease your power, you're going to decrease the amount of strength that you have going into it. The gallop through trial and error, people must have figured out that it was just a more efficient way to transfer the force, the momentum.

07-interviewer
So is that transferring it... to go up? Or to go forward? Or...

07-participant
So I would say that um, probably to go forward because it has to do with your momentum, punching will actually send you soaring, it'll send you up quite a bit. Punching will decrease your horizontal, horizontal momentum. It's like, it's like punching like stops you and then you keep going. It like re-translates it. So you know, the gallop allows you to kind of smoothly like do it, you basically do what the punch is doing in two steps like the second, like the first, and let the penultimate step kind of lowers you even further and really primes, you, and then that last step really launches you off. So it can happen more smoothly as you take off for the Kong.

07-interviewer
And so you mentioned, like trajectory, and power as well.

07-participant
Right.

07-interviewer
Are they, is that stuff kind of coming from the takeoff?

07-participant
That stuff comes from you, your trajectory is going to come from your takeoff, and also, it's going to come from the way that your arms push, you know, um, if you want to get height, like for example, if I'm going for a kong precision that's higher than what I'm taking off of, I'm not going to pull at all, I'm going to straight push, it is like a dip at that point, because I'm only looking to get height, I'm not going to be looking to get any distance. But if you're looking to maintain your height while getting distance, like what you would need for, say, a level kong precision, you're going to want to push and then also follow through quite a bit. So that you're encouraging your body to, to contain that to maintain that trajectory and follow that path. When you're going downwards, you know, you still want to pop, but it's gonna definitely be a lot more of that sliding motion, and maintaining your speed through through your takeoff, to get the distance. Like, besides what your arms are doing, the speed of your takeoff is gonna make a huge impact on how far you're able to travel. Like the biggest thing that I find that even up to like intermediate, even some advanced athletes do is as they're running up to the wall, they subconsciously slowed down in their last two steps. And it's not a conscious process for most people. But like the challenge is in getting like, comfortable, you know, approaching the wall, and, you know, going aggressive in that last second, like I love the term Kong because you know it kinda it kind of like emphasises that like gorilla nature that you kind of have to have as you go in at a kong like it is one of the most aggressive moves in my opinion. Like you really need to, like fully go for it and fully apply like the full range of all the techniques in order to get the distance. And you know, if even one variable is off, you're gonna you're gonna be off the money for you know, making the stick.

07-interviewer
So is that, is that aggressiveness like... because, because of that need for like a commitment to really dive in headfirst or...?

07-participant
It's, yeah, it's basically just the simple fact that you're running at a brick wall or at a railing. You know, it's something that I think brains have a hard time dealing with when you start doing parkour. So a lot of the time I see it in people, but um, yeah, like that's where training comes in. And repetition comes in because there's a there's definitely a disconnect between knowing technique, especially like with Kongs, and like with laches and stuff like that, and execute, and comfortably executing. It's like not being in fight-flight when you're doing it, so that you know you're calm, and you can just focus on exactly what you're doing. And yeah, usually, that works the best.

07-interviewer
Does that kind of come come from just repetition?

07-participant
It comes from repetition, I would recommend breathing, knowing your technique. Also, like, for a lot of people, they bash their knee, like once on a Kong. And that really slows them down. That's really why we need that space that we were discussing earlier, like the space between your very last step, and the wall is gonna allow you the room to the room for your knees to clear also raising your hips is going to give you room for your knees to clear and maintaining your speed as you do so. So, you know, knowing the technique and being confident in the technique, really, I feel like eliminates fear, because and by doing that over and over again, it's not just the logical of knowing, like I know the technique, you know, you have the backlog of experience of doing the techniques so that there's nothing to worry about.

07-interviewer
Do you find that it's like, a difficult move for people to learn?

07-participant
It depends on the person. Um, it's difficult for people if they have left-right imbalances. So if say, the right side of their body is much more coordinated than their left side and their and they have a tendency to like list to one side, they're going to have a very hard time straightening out their kong. That's the most common issue I see is people doing, you know, side vaults or like modified kash vaults, as they're learning to do a Kong. Um, so for that specific thing, I have a drill that I teach my students, which is, um, I teach them to kong up, first. So I have them basically run out a block, and they kong, they do the Kong, and instead of looking to clear, they do it to their feet landing in the middle. And they'll repeat the process of doing that three to five times, and then I'll tell them, okay, now do faster. And then they do that like three times, then I say, do it even faster. And it gets to a point where their feet are just barely tapping the block. And by then I'm like, Okay, now do it again, keep your hips high, and tuck in your knees, and a lot of the time they end up clearing. So that's, that definitely does it, I also will tell my students to remember to put equal weight on both of their hands. Because the tendency to list to one side and look like a side vault tends to be from that. Um, and then yeah, and then the other thing is getting people comfortable mentally with doing things on their opposite side. So like, if you can get a student to feel comfortable doing a side vault, to their right side, when they always go to their left side, then they don't necessarily have to resort to going to that side as a bailout, because they're scared in the movement, like they kind of have a little bit more proprioception of where their body is, so that they can remain in line and know what being in line actually feels like. I feel like a lot of students aren't quite conscious of that yet. What being aligned feels like.

07-interviewer
So is it, do you find that it's perhaps not a, er, I don't want to say like a not a natural movement, but like, it's not something that people kind of instinctively might do, without without being shown first, or...?

07-participant
Let me think about that one. Is it not natural? I believe it is natural, but it's not comfortable. It's just not comfortable for a lot of people. I would imagine that, you know, in the wild people were doing a lot more safety vaults, and side vaults than Kong vaults. So I guess, I guess yeah, it's probably not the most natural of movements. It's not the most natural but it becomes very useful once you know how to use it.

07-interviewer
What, erm, why would it be useful? What kind of things is it useful for?

07-participant
It's useful for I'm essentially getting distance when there's a wall in front of you, if you want to, if you want to jump and you're like, say getting chased. You can only really effectively take off of like such a height and then it becomes like a huge step up or you have to stop and plyo off of it. There comes a point where, you know, just being able to push yourself over it and travel becomes the more efficient way and it opens up a whole lot of challenges. So in those regards, it's very useful also, um, in certain contexts, a dive kong may be faster than doing like a plyo down or say like or safety vault down depending. So it like that. And then with double Kongs, if you really want to travel distance and you really feel comfortable with them, you can travel further on the double kong than you can on on a Kong Precision and even on a standing precision, um, not that I recommend, you know, going for 10 foot double Kongs for everybody like I don't do those, but, but it's theoretically possible. Like if you look at like what [name] done what some of the French guys have done with double Kongs, like they can soar like 11, 12 feet off of these things.

07-interviewer
Is, um. Is that kind of that ability to travel quite far on the other side of it an important factor? Is that something useful rather?

07-participant
So the ability to travel far, like on a Kong Precision? You mean? It's just-

07-interviewer
[overlap] Yeah, yeah. The move in general, I guess.

07-participant
Yeah, the, um, part of the utility of the Kong vault is that it's the most powerful of all of the vaults, as opposed to safeties or dashes or anything, Kong is always going to make you go the furthest. As long as you know, you know how to do it. So Kongs are effective in that, you know, out of the vault, you're going to go the furthest.

07-interviewer
Okay. Is, um, just to kind of rewind a tiny bit, is the upper body contributing to that distance? Or is it all coming from the takeoff?

07-participant
I would say it's, maybe... 60-40. 60% legs, 40%, arms and upper body. Um, cos you know, you need to make sure your arms job on the takeoff is to give you some extra power and distance, but it's also to help you position your chest right, so that you can land like safely and comfortably. So, like, yes, it's more so a jump, like, it's almost like that staggered plyo, like we were talking about. But yeah, the arms do help.

07-interviewer
So that that kind of when you're over the obstacle, you know, there's obviously going to be a bunch of different ways you could land and heights and distances and all sorts of objects you could land on. But is there is there like a certain way you want to be coming out of the movement to be safe, or, or...?

07-participant
Yes. So there's particularly um, let's go over the one thing that you don't want to do, and then I'll explain, like what you do want to do. So what you don't want is your chest down. So I'm gonna stand up and show you like, so if you do, you're kong, and your chest is too far over. You know, you end up flailing and you're uncomfortable. We, we, in the Long Island community call that Millennium Falconing, or Falconing for short [laugh] And so so to avoid that, like, what we do is as we fall through, we make sure that we push, like with the chest and you raise with the chest, like as I kong, I go like this [raises chest] so that I allow my chest to rise as I'm pushing so I can stick out my feet, bring my arms back and come in for a nice landing. It's all in chest positioning and being mindful of the fact that I'm pushing through the chest using everything.

07-interviewer
And is that is that only if you're trying to land on something for like a precision or is that also if you're trying to come out to a run, it's generally good to get the chest up?

07-participant
I would say that's generally good technique. Um, you know, I was doing a Kong splat back over the weekend. And for that, you know, you still want to keep your chest in a safe position, like in an upright somewhat position. But I did come forward, you know, to do the splat back because that's part of the technique. But that was very intentional. And still, of course, my feet were hitting the trees surface before, you know, my upper body wasn't anywhere close to it. So I modified it slightly, but, you know, the same principles still apply.

07-interviewer
I'm curious as well, you know, with the various ways you could take off, or the various ways you can land. And you've mentioned some of the like variations like double Kong as well. Like are these all just variation on the same movement? Do you think? Or are they distinct?

07-participant
Yeah, like they're all Kongs because you know they're the symmetrical two handed vaults going through a plane that lies within the two hands. Um, so in that regard, yes, they are all the same, but the techniques, but the techniques are going to be different. I would say that somebody who has proficiency in like one type of vault one type of kong may or may not have proficiency in another type like I know some people are excellent at dive konging, but aren't anything crazy remarkable at double konging, I mean, or at like Kongs precisioning but for a double Kong I feel like you need to you need to have skill in both. Like I would argue that double Kong is the most advanced Kong skill, maybe triple Kongs and whatever you know, but double Kong generally takes like a Kong Precision sort of takeoff and then it goes into a dive kong in midair.

07-interviewer
And that you really need to get the hips up.

07-participant
Yes, you really need to get the hips up. The way I learned was I started with Kong Precision then I went to Kong safety then I went to Kong dive roll, and then I went to double Kong.

07-interviewer
Cool. How um, mentioning about, about yourself learning double Kongs? How, how did you find learning the Kong for yourself, back in the day?

07-participant
I found the Kong to be very challenging because I had that left-right, um, non-symmetrical thing going on. I was very, I would always list to the right side like my hips would always pick up this way as I would do my Kongs. And you can even see it sometimes in my dive Kongs, if I'm doing one that's like at the edge of my range, I will shift my hips a little that way still. Um, so that was really my big struggle with them. But like as I started getting comfy with them, they're great fun, like they're an awesome move to do. Like you can apply them to so many different scenarios. But it was a process to get there. I also want to mention that rail kongs are a bit of a different animal, in that a rail kong, you have to change your approach and your running speed. And you have to pull as opposed to push you like if you try pushing on a rail, you're rolling the dice on your hands being perfect. Like it's really like, people do it. I've seen people go huge on rail kongs, you know, doing sketchy tech, and you know, hats off to them. They're comfy with it, but, but like, if you're like the rest of us and you don't really want to faceplant like you need to grab and pull, you know, and that really makes for... I tend to have like a slightly slower run up. And then really, really emphasise those last two steps and accelerating through those last, those last two steps as I as I go to grab and really rip the rail behind me, I got like, I'm almost doing like a row with it, like, pulling it really, really hard in that movement.

07-interviewer
Mm.

07-participant
So it that in that way the technique changes.

07-interviewer
So it's more it becomes more of a pull than a push.

07-participant
Yes. And you also want to um, switch up your driving distance because now we you're, you can't go quite as hard. You kind of want to dive from further away. And still and like junk to kind of make up for that. Like on a I'm on like a fence like a high kong that's on like a rail. So it's like a fence or something, you really want to make sure that you have enough distance to clear your body because now you're not pushing to give yourself height to clear it. So you need to dive to make sure that you still have enough room to clear that object. You see, it's like um, you're trying to find a different way to compensate for the lack of push.

07-interviewer
Is that is that because you can't get the hand flat?

07-participant
Right? You you don't have enough space. It's um, it's a lack of space thing. And like I said, some people will do it. It's just you know, it's riskier.

07-interviewer
So would you would you encounter a similar thing if you had just like a really thin wall, like if it was still flat in theory, but just kind of less less wide than your hand-

07-participant
I hate those kind of kong pres, those are the worst-

07-interviewer
The worst of both worlds?

07-participant
[laugh] Yeah, it's like, yeah, it is the worst of both worlds because you can't fully grab it, you can't, you got to like, kind of push. Those ones are tough, I'll tell you those ones are tough. Um, yeah, it's almost like a rail kong in those situations. But you know, you because you can't grab around, you still need to try and push. So every single Kong, what's interesting is that you kind of have to figure out what is going to work when you're in that grey area, it's going to be a little bit of application of both techniques, which is, you know, yet again, why having a backlog of experience of practice on all these different types of surfaces makes weird encounters like that, you know, more usable, or like if they're different levels, or whatever the case may be.

07-interviewer
So the kind of environment you're performing it in has a has an effect on the movement?

07-participant
100% 100%, every different type of Kong that you encounter is going to have a different sort of movement. I've done kong precisions, from little walkway, curbs that are yay-high off the ground, you know, and I'm basically doing a toe touch as I'm running at it, you know, my hips are like, way higher than my head. I'm like, I look like a little Gremlin running like, but it but that's the way do the technique when it's that low. Because it's all hips, and it's all push for that. Um, yeah, so every single kong is going to have a different technique to some extent.

07-interviewer
But I guess, you know, that's kind of part of what I'm doing the study for the the common feature then, is that two hands, feet and knees between the hands kind of characteristics?

07-participant
Yes, the two hands, feet, and two hands, feet and knees clear. And the plyo, the plyo esque nature of the takeoff, and then the plyo esque nature of the hand push, like the hand push and pull is almost like a second plyo. I actually read that in um, do you know Max Henry?

07-interviewer
Yes.

07-participant
Yeah, I read in his book, that, um, that, you know, basically, the Kong is a plyo, followed by another player with the hands. And I've taken that and ran with it. And I definitely see that as true. It's like, it's a plyo. And then your hands as sits the prior that you just did to really launch you in the direction you're going.

07-interviewer
Hmm. What about if, if someone has like particularly good flexibility or mobility, and they can just not even take their hands off the obstacle and just jump their feet through the middle?

07-participant
Like a kash vault?

07-interviewer
I guess it would become a cash flow by that point wouldn't it. So the kind of pop with the hands you think is is kind of integral to the Kong otherwise it becomes more like a kash?

07-participant
Well, when it becomes like a kash, by keeping your hands on that long, you're inadvertently going to have to shift your weight to make sure that you're able to reach reach like that. And in doing so, you're killing your forward momentum. So you're not gonna travel as far I like, I can guarantee that it's a great move for flow. And for connecting lines, you know, sometimes even in a speed situation, like if you can't make the full distance going into a kash, when you have a little bit less power is more efficient. Um, but that would not generally be good for the exit distance.

07-interviewer
So, so we talked a little bit about, like, you know, you learn again, did you learn the Kong vault from somewhere in particular? Can you remember, or did you just see it and experiment?

07-participant
So I learned from a couple different places, I remember watching some Tapp Brother videos on YouTube as a little kid, um, and then I remember being introduced through some people in the parkour community where I lived. I saw them doing Kong vaults, and they were giving me drills, basically the Kong up drill that I teach my students I learned from just community sessions with the guys and then I took parkour classes at a local gymnastics gym for the first two years of my training where I learned the progression of Kong precision, Kong safety, Kong dive roll, and then the double Kong and dive Kongs. Like, I learned all that stuff in the gym, like, and then from there, I started taking the movements outside.

07-interviewer
And when you started to move into coaching, did you, did you find that, you know, you had to update your idea of the kong vault in any way or did you just take what you already had and just start coaching basically, that?

07-participant
I find that coaching is always, it's dynamic. First of all, you know, as a coach, you can't forget that you're always a student as well. And that, you know, there's always more to learn about any technique. So, the way I teach Kongs has evolved a little bit in that, um, you know, like I said, I just learned that hips up technique from one of my friends, you know, so I'm just continuing to pick up techniques, and as I learn techniques, I transfer them right on through to my students. Um, but yeah, really, a lot of the general ideas I've had for a good couple years on how to do Kongs, but it's, it's an ongoing process. And I always want to give my students the most up to date, version of my knowledge. I'm, like, really, the challenge with students is wording things in a way that makes it click for them, and giving them the right progressions, so that they can feel comfortable to do it.

07-interviewer
And is there, are there any places that you kind of look to, to get that kind of the updated information as you go on, or places where you maybe discuss things like this?

07-participant
Really, it's very informal, like besides the book, Max's book, um, it's very informal, it's like, at jams, we just talk we're working on a catpass we're working on Kong, you know, and I'm like, Oh, you want to try like this? Like, what do you think of that technique, take a look at this from the side, watch me, you know, we all just analyse each other. And we'll give each other feedback, and then take that. That's, that's more so I would say how I've learned.

07-interviewer
Quite a kind of social community thing.

07-participant
Very social, very social, very communal, sometimes arguing, but [laugh] you know.

07-interviewer
Has anyone had like, completely wild and different ideas about these things that you've gone, I dunno where they thought that, got that from, or do people kind of tend to come towards the similar similar conclusions?

07-participant
People tend to come to similar conclusions, but sometimes, sometimes they do things in different ways. Um, there's one dude, I know who, um, he's, he's a sketchy jumper, like, I'm going to talk about his jump, like, he doesn't really stick his legs out at all, he can go far. He's basically like, his mentality is I run fast. And then I took my knees, run fast jump and tuck my knees. And he just does it. And he I haven't seen him really hurt himself doing it yet. But you know, that's a pretty that's a pretty out there kind of training technique that I would never tell, I would never tell my students do that. But for him, it works. Um, the, my friend who taught me about the hips, he was, you know, he wasn't training for that long. He just kind of discovered that one. And then told me about it. I saw him I noticed I was like, dude, like, whenever you kong, like, your hips are like, high. Kinda like, um, you know, like the blue shorts, brothers.

07-interviewer
Yeah, I know the video you're talking about, actually.

07-participant
Yes. Yeah. That's sort of the way that I noticed my friend was Kong. And I asked him about it. And he kind of explained it and broke down. Why that why like, he was doing that. And he's been training probably like three years. And for three years of doing parkour, he's never clipped his knees. So I think that it's a safer technique as well as more powerful. And it's, you know, obviously excellent for dives and doubles.

07-interviewer
I remember the famous video that came out for them. And I remember watching it and just being like, what are they doing? It looked it was so obviously different to what I was used to seeing. I remember that I'm gonna have to go back and watch that video.

07-participant
Mmhmm. Really inspired me.

07-interviewer
Yeah, it's very cool. How, how do you get the hips higher? Just thinking about it? What is it? Is it just jumping more or is it being more willing to put your head down or...?

07-participant
It's not your head, it's um, it's basically hips is a nice way of saying it it's your butt, you know, you lift your butt up, you know, you want to basically keep your butt higher and also like run with like your back a little bit round, like arched and like, almost hollow. It's kind of like a hollow position that you're in. Like, as you as I take off for the Kong, I'm not just doing this, I'm going. So I go like that and like, pushes up. That's how you'll really like get the, get the angle for it.

07-interviewer
So it comes from kind of the position you're in on takeoff.

07-participant
Yes.

07-interviewer
Setting yourself up for that.

07-participant
Setting myself up for it. And I also think about consciously lifting them up as I'm running. So like, I'm running in almost a hollow position as I'm dipping down, so I'm ready ready for it?

07-interviewer
Okay, so just with coaching in general, I can't remember if I've already asked this, do you find that, erm, people coming to classes and things, find that they want to learn that movement? Do they know what it is before they come along? Or is it brand new to them?

07-participant
So- Everybody has seen a Kong vault, but they don't know that it's a Kong vault. I'll be, I'll show them the move and they're like, oh my god, I've seen that before. Like, what is that? It's like Kong vault and wall runs. And then like wall flips, all that kind of stuff. Like they all see it. And they all want to do it. But they don't know. They don't know. That's the name of it. I've had people like, ask me like, what's the move where you put your hands down and you're like diving at something? I'm like, oh, Kong vault.

07-interviewer
Mm hmm.

07-participant
I've had that a few times.

07-interviewer
So is it, do you think it's quite like a famous parkour move? Is it is it like, identifiably, oh if you see that guy's doing parkour, that kind of thing?

07-participant
Sure. Oh, for sure. Yeah, for sure. Kong is one of those things, I can't help but think of like, the speed vault like the speed air man, David Belle silhouette, as like an image of parkour. Um, you know, the running and standing precision are very important. The wall run is very important. Those are all very, like staple parkour moves that anybody would see and be like, Oh, he's doing parkour, you know? Yeah, they see. Yeah, they see you doing like something more obscure like trying for like a level four climb up there. Like what's he doing? He's just messing around on a wall.

07-interviewer
Mm. So I find it interesting use the word like, staple parkour movement. So is it, is it, is the Kong vault something that you think, you know, if someone comes along to learn parkour, that's a thing they should learn? Or at least try?

07-participant
Absolutely, absolutely. Um, you know, I know a few athletes who have limitations in their wrists where they can't do Kong vaults. But without fail, they all want to do Kong vaults. Like sticking a nice kong precision is just a very satisfying experience. I would say there, yeah, it's a nice move to know and have in your arsenal, especially now where I am in Florida. The community is, um, has an influence from like the Spaniards and then like the Florida community was all about like going big for a long time. So kong pres are a big part of what we do here.

07-interviewer
Mm. Do you think as well they kind of lend themselves to quite, I mean, you say big, like, just impressive movements as well?

07-participant
Yes. Kongs look good on camera. Definitely. You know, you get the person midway, their arms fully drawn back that, like intense face? It's um, yeah, it definitely is one that, you know, does well on social media.

07-interviewer
Mm. So when when people come to classes, and they're like, I want to learn this move that I have you found that people pick it up pretty easy? Or is it a hard one for people to learn?

07-participant
It depends on the person. I've had people learn it in their first day, and I've had people a month or two in still struggling on it. It really depends on individual coordination and their ability to manage their own fear. That's really a big factor in parkour, that I think some coaches talk about, but I don't think enough coaches talk about is that, you know, students are scared a lot of the time because it's very unfamiliar to them. And, you know, getting especially a non athletic student who doesn't, you know, hasn't done any sports or gymnastics or anything before to do it. You know, you really need to make them feel comfortable before, they're in the mindset for committing to, you know, something that they might perceive as dangerous or scary.

07-interviewer
Are the, like common coaching cues or exercises you'd use to teach people the movement?

07-participant
Yeah, like what I went over before with the Kong ups. Yeah, that's, that's a big one. That's definitely definitely a big one. And with that one, what I start with is, I start them doing it standing. And then I have them run into it. And when I start them running into it, I have them punch. And over time I develop I teach them how to do the stagger because if you, essentially the gallup like jump is like a punch, but it's in two steps. So it's more, it's more comfortable for them learning that way. That's the way that I learned. Um, and yeah, like from there, once they're able to do the Kong through, I start, you know, working them on, you know, takeoff distance and exit distance. And then I also have them try it out of moves, like, from a two footed stance, you know, like a, like a, say, a standing precision dive kong out, you know, and I start introducing them to other circumstances where they can do the vaults, but um, as for drills, that's the main drill I have them do, and I start them, if I have it available for me, I start them on a soft block as opposed to something hard, so that they, you know, aren't as afraid of their knees.

07-interviewer
Is, um, what, what are the things you're kind of looking for, in terms of assessing how someone, how good someone is doing at the Kong vault, when you're coaching them? Are there are there things you're kind of looking at going ah, they need to change this or need to improve that, anything...

07-participant
Of course, but first one other thing, um, if they're really struggling to get their feet through, I have them do this exercise. I have them stand still with the with the wall in front of them like this. And I have them just jump and stick their butt up. I have them go like this. And from doing that, jumping, pushing their butt up, they can get used to the height that they're going to need for their feet to clear

07-interviewer
out getting the hips up again.

07-participant
Yes, getting the hips up again. It's quite important. Yes. So for assessment, yeah, I'm going to look at their hip position. I'm going to look for symmetry in their kong. I'm going to look for them dipping before takeoff, I'm going to look for whether their feet are together or staggered, how fast they're running, whether or not they're stopping. Um, what they're chest positioning is upon takeoff. I'm going to look at all of those different things.

07-interviewer
Are there any kind of, I forgot, if you said... Okay, so, at the moment, you're coaching, self employed, I believe, right? Were you previously part of a coaching organisation?

07-participant
Yes, I was. I've coached at two different gyms. So the first gym that I worked at was called [name]. I ended up working there for about six months until they closed down the parkour programme. I worked with a couple other coaches, it was a big, big facility, they had like a nice parkour gym set up, I had whatever I need to teach them basically all the skills of parkour. When I switched gyms, it was more of a fitness studio, it's known as [name]. And there, it's basically they had some vault boxes, and some little precision trainers. And that was about it. So a little bit more challenging to make do, but it was a more intimate setting, I got to know the kids really well. So it ended up being quite successful in that way. And then COVID hit, and now I'm just doing my thing on my own.

07-interviewer
Yeah, great isn't it.

07-participant
[laugh]

07-interviewer
I'm curious when you were working with, you know, an organisation, were there any kind of guidelines on how to coach particular skills to people or any kind of you guys get together as a group or was it just down to the individual?

07-participant
So we had a monthly curriculum, but, um, I don't know not to, not to be conceited or whatever, but I would kind of ignore the curriculum, like, I would listen to the curriculum, but then kind of like, go beyond it. And then my classes ended up having the most kids at the gym, like at the first gym. And I think it was because I was very dynamic to whatever the kids were wanting that day, or like, whatever, um, whatever it seemed like they needed to learn or whatever, we hadn't hit the previous week. So it was kind of intuitive. And I would always be building upon what they learned the week before, so that they're just adding the pieces and putting the puzzle pieces together. Like even if it was like explicitly stride week, I was gonna do like, Kong, stride out of it, you know, do two steps, you know, do a safety, stride out of it, you know, so I'm trying to throw everything together within the context of whatever the monthly goal was.

07-interviewer
One of the things I've kind of been curious about talking to a whole bunch of parkour coaches is, you know, a lot of these things, it's it seems to be down to the individual coach to how they want to coach these movements. Do you think it's, it would be useful for us as a community to kind of have more guidelines be like, hey, this works for coaching the Kong vault, this doesn't, or...

07-participant
Yes, but I wonder who would want to do it without monetizing it? Because I know that something similar to that already exists with the APEX guys out in Colorado, with their Parkour EDU programme. Like they, they've already written out curriculums and guidelines, and all and all this sort of stuff, but I believe it's copyrighted material. So it would be wonderful, but I don't know, you know, who's gonna make those standardisations.

07-interviewer
The, the only reason I kind of I'm trying to explore this with people is because I am curious how much of the kind of like, people don't kind of want to put restrictions on parkour. You know, we've all benefited from it being a wide open movement, discipline, or whatever you want to call it. Sport, martial art, I don't know, whatever people call it. But-

07-participant
All the above.

07-interviewer
It seems like it's kind of evolving into into being a little bit more organised. I'm just curious how people kind of feel about that, whether those two things having guidelines for for coaching and safekeeping and stuff can can coexist with a wide open decentralised kind of sport.

07-participant
I think guidelines would be good. And we really do have guidelines, like they're just informal guidelines. Like if you um, if you go to a gym, your town, you're going to see most people doing their precisions with feet together, drawing their arms back midair and bring their arms forward upon landing. It's um, there's a lot of different things like that. Kongs already have sort of a generalised, you know, guideline, it's just not explicitly stated, I feel like, I feel like we, within the parkour community, we visually know, like, if you're an athlete who's been training more than like, two years, you can visually tell when somebody does or doesn't know, a technique, but, you know, having some kind of real statement of exactly what it should be would be really nice. Because then, you know, then, you know, that serves as a nice reference guide for any beginner. Mm hmm. But I think it does already kind of exist in the minds of, of like practitioners and like, within the mind of a community.

07-interviewer
Do you think that's just kind of just kind of sprung up over time?

07-participant
It's, it's like, almost like social, like, it sounds, it sounds funny, but like, it's, um, it's almost like when you train with a group, it almost is like social cohesion, like, everybody has, like good tech, you know, or like, you try to have like, the right tech. And, yeah, like, I think that it kind of just comes from social understanding within our community. Like, its um, you know, it's just kind of learned, you visually pick it up. You know, if a lot of people who start now just watch Instagram videos, and if you watch enough Instagram videos of people doing parkour, you can see what those techniques should look like.

07-interviewer
Just to kind of, the good things kind of spread.

07-participant
Yeah, good things spread. And yeah, techniques and ideas spread. And, you know, videos of people doing them are kind of the justification or the proof that whatever they're doing is working.

07-interviewer
Mm

07-participant
Mm-hmm. But if there were to be if there were to be a group of people who said, okay, so after interviewing 100 coaches, you know, this is what the consensus agreed upon was the best technique. And then you tested that with a bunch of students, and had like an experiment where you had them do like, YouTube technique, or just try and figure it out off of a video without explanation, as opposed to with the explanation, you know, and you could, you know, find a nice way to do a controlling variable of it, you could, you could probably figure out a nice way to get people learning the techniques through it. I think that would be really, really useful for beginners.

07-interviewer
Yeah, I mean, it's it's not kind of the main intention of this study, but it's something that I've found even in just talking to a few people so far is that coaches from, you know, all over the world? The answers I'm getting from people are remarkably consistent.

07-participant
Are they?

07-interviewer
Mmm.

07-participant
What, what, um, I don't know if you can disclose this, but what kind of similarities and differences have you heard?

07-interviewer
I mean, it's, it's been a lot of the, a lot of the similar things that you've said, you know, the thing that's really identifiable with the kong is the two hands on the obstacle, feet through the middle, and stuff about like taking off and landing can change and vary, and it's environmentally situational, and things like that. A lot of the coaching techniques are very similar. So things like popping up the hip stuff has come up a couple of times. A lot of people have given very consistent answers about, you know, learning the movement, being challenging, its potentially an intimidating movement. So it's been really interesting. Seeing that actually, even learning from different sources. And different, being in different, different geographic locations. These things have stayed pretty consistent. And this is why I've started asking people about guidelines and things because, as you say, it seems like it already is kind of happening, just not written down anywhere.

07-participant
Yeah, it's, it's just nonverbal right now, huh? Yeah, it's not explicitly stated. But for sure, I think that anyone who knows can see when, when like, a person's technique is good or bad or otherwise. Mm-mm.

07-interviewer
Is, um, is there anything about the Kong vault that you'd be curious to find out for yourself?

07-participant
Um...

07-interviewer
It's okay, if the answer's no, by the way

07-participant
I do, I do have some, um, so I guess... What differentiating factors make a person like [name] or [name] just fly on their Kong vault, it's like, I have pretty good technique. But like, they go like thirty feet, four feet further than me, like, how's that even possible? You know, so, stuff like that, like how they are just able to go on, like disgusting distances. That's super impressive to me. Um, also, I would like to know about, um, I guess the different optimal acceleration, like, I know, by feel that you don't want to sprint but you want to go hard enough. And then you want to almost sprint as you're taking off. But I want to see if there's, you know, more of a consensus on what the optimal running speed and the optimal running like height because you do have to dip, you know, whether it's better to start up and dip fast or start already a little dipped and then run in, um, those different like, approach sort of things. And I've seen many different people do different things. I've seen people kong further than me running hunched over, you know, sprinting at a wall, and I've seen people you know, Kong way further than me and almost not dip at all. So, I want to see, um, you know, what, is the better way and if it's based on your know your body, the person who did it, who really really dipped was a lot shorter. The person who barely dipped was super tall. I don't know if that plays a factor in dipping height with Kongs. Um, what else um, I guess I know pretty much about where you want to take off optimally for your kongs. Maybe maybe optimising rail kong technique with the pull, you know? How to, like make sure that you can always compensate. I think a lot of the time it's um, I guess a lot of the time it's really just having the balls to go at it really hard. And that's comfort but if there are specific techniques, because first standing Kong I learned this one technique, my friend was like, oh the people in England figured this out and like I've never heard anybody do this in America was like you put your chest to the bar, and then sink back and then go for the standing rail kong. Which kind of-

07-interviewer
Like a countermovement jump.

07-participant
Yeah, like you, like you do like a little like, you go up close, and then you sink down. And it's almost like a tendon rebound take off, which I've never seen before that. So yeah, like there's different things like, like those but really the how how the heck did the top athletes do it? And what's the best way to run it a wall? Upright or hunched?

07-interviewer
Do you have any like, theories about what might what might make people like, I think you said [name], I presume, right, just fly, like...

07-participant
Absolute ability to use all of his strength.

07-interviewer
Hmm.

07-participant
Um, I think that's another thing that I've meant that I've noticed like some, like [name] does is he has no fear sprinting, like really really hard at things. And I would, and I've seen [name] run really are the things too. Also [name] kind of runs like a gorilla, like he really hunches his shoulders a lot, as he's coming at it, which may add for increased range of motion from like, here to here. So that might have to do with it. Um, probably pushes really hard, um, he might just have a really good body composition for like, pushing and getting distance and like, based on the techniques, it's, it's hard to say, Yeah, but um, but I would guess that it's those and also just tonnes and tonnes of confidence with them.

07-interviewer
Hmm.

07-participant
I think that that's a huge factor always.

07-interviewer
Yeah. I,um, actually something you said reminded me something I forgot got to ask, which was about strength, because you mentioned the strength. It, does strength play a role? Like if you're stronger in the upper body? For example, can you push further on it?

07-participant
I would say I would say no, um, the upper body, the push and the strength of it is, is a factor a little bit. Like if you don't have strength, you should get some strength, but the upper body strength and a Kong vault will probably be diminishing returns. Because, um, you know, it is more so from technique and aggression and, like power and takeoff. You know, I think that um, just practising the vault itself will give your arms the strength that they need to perform it well. Um, training plyos and different stuff with your legs will get your legs ready to do the Kong, I think yeah, it's, it's a power move, you know, when you're going for distance. And you could essentially, Kong, kong pre, I would say most people can kong pre two to three feet less than their standing precision. You know, they say that you can kong pre what you're standing precision is. And I know like one person who can do that. Yes, if you have all of your strength and you go all out. Yes, but most people aren't doing that. So I would say two to three feet less is feasible. Mm

07-interviewer
Cool.

07-participant
Yeah.

07-interviewer
I'm aware of the time, I don't want to monopolise too much of your afternoon. Is there, we've kind of hit all the main points I like to try and get to with people. Is there anything else that you know has popped into your head or you thought of at any point that we didn't get to that you might like to add?

07-participant
Well, there's always new types of Kongs coming out. Like there's lots of new ways that people are doing them like have you ever seen the cat back Kong? I love that move, like people are in cat. And they like push off the wall turn, throw their hips like 20 feet up. And-

07-interviewer
Okay. Yes, I know what you mean.

07-participant
That's a technique, I want to learn how to do better. Like that's one that I've seen, it seems super impressive. And that's a really, really cool application of the Kong vault. Um, I just wanted to add that, you know, in case um, but I don't necessarily even know the technique for that one. Like, that would be something that I would have to ask a friend about, you know.

07-interviewer
I guess with that kind of movement, that's where I get really interested about like, why is that still a kong when it's so different to everything else?

07-participant
Because the hands, it's the hands and torso.

07-interviewer
[overlap] Because the hands.

07-participant
Exactly. Like as long as your hands are in that position. You're diving at something your hands are in that position. And then, hmm, here's something, yeah, so the hands in a lot of Kongs, like a kong like that, or like a dive kong. Like where you're not going for distance, your hands changing from like this diving position to an upright position. Like it kind of um, I don't know the exact physics, but it is some kind of physics mechanism that like changes the position of your body. Um, so as long as you're diving, your hands touch and then the position of your body changes. It's a kong.

07-interviewer
Right.

07-participant
And then your momentum is carrying through.

07-interviewer
Yeah. I guess in that case, the things that change around it depend on your goal in that moment, you know. Are you trying to get distance to land on something far away? Or are you just trying to get over the wall? Because you've just done a cat back...?

07-participant
Exactly. Exactly. Um, yeah, that's a very interesting way that people will kong. I also want to mention that, have you ever seen [name] video of [name] doing the Kong front, like 30 feet out into the water? And that video in some way [unclear]

07-interviewer
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

07-participant
I wanna, I want to mention that Kong as something that is immaculate, but also that doing the kong front, theoretically, is the most powerful way to do, to do a Kong.

07-interviewer
Really.

07-participant
Because here's the thing is that when you do a kong precision, that change in body direction, happens, like you go from here to here. In a koong front, you go from here, to just rotating over. And there doesn't have to be like any change, like from this, so you just go. And you can fling yourself like, obviously, it's less controlled. But it's the, it is more powerful, like you can just completely throw yourself and have no resistance. So if there was ever like some sort of competition, or something where people were going for straight up vault power, like, like a long jump competition, probably kong fronts would eventually become the best technique for vaulting over something and going as far as you can.

07-interviewer
Interesting. So that's because you're not kind of... yeah, as you say, you're not trying to get the chest back up. You just keep going with the dive.

07-participant
Yeah. [unclear] Allowing yourself to rotate.

07-interviewer
Do you think the upper body is still doing anything in that kind of vault? Or do you think it's just tapping the wall as you dive over?

07-participant
Pushing. It's, all all that it's doing is pushing and giving you a little bit more.

07-interviewer
Mm.

07-participant
Mmhmm. You're putting your, you basically are probably using your arms so that you know your head doesn't hit and so that you can clear and get as much you know, oomph as possible, you're still probably konging in a very close to a kong position. So your arms are still doing that. But then on your exit, you're just allowing your hips to keep on rising so that you rotate around.

07-interviewer
Hmm. Interesting, I'm gonna have to go back and watch that video as well as the blue shorts one.

07-participant
Yeah, you can analyse those videos that have, I feel like they'll show you a whole tonne about, you know what the Kong is all about. And what optimal technique for different things is. Yeah.

07-interviewer
Cool. Okay, yeah. Is there anything else you want to throw in?

07-participant
Is there anything else? I think that hits about all of it that I want to that I want to add. Um, yeah, that's about it. Um, this is this is cool. I've never, I've never really fleshed out all of the technique, you know, for to another advanced practitioner who wants to understand it like this, because I normally as a coach, I'm administering this information in small doses to people so that they can grasp all of it. But um, but yeah, this was this was very cool. Very interesting in that way.

07-interviewer
I'm glad. It's something I've I've kind of seen in a couple of people I've been talking to where they know it, but they've never had to verbalise it. And so you can almost see them as they're putting the words in order in their head going, Yeah, okay. I knew this, but I hadn't ever, like expressed it in this way before.

07-participant
Haven't fully walked somebody through the process from beginning to end. Like that. Yeah. So I think that like what you were doing by like, kind of asking the questions to guide like, what's the step? What's that step? What's that step? What's that step? That really helps somebody really process what where exactly like the next move is in what needs to be considered. Oh, yeah, it was a cool experience.

07-interviewer
Good. I'm glad. I'll um, I'll stop the recording. In that case, just bear with me a second.
