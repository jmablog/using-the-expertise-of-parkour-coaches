02-interviewer
All right. So I guess just to kind of explain a little bit about the study, just to give you a little background, I know you read the information sheet, as well. I'm just basically looking to talk to people, coaches and people who have coached in the past as well, about the way that they kind of understand some techniques in parkour. And in particular, I've picked the Kong Vault for this one, just because it's quite a kind of iconic parkour movement. Trying to think about how people understand these movements when there isn't like a central governing body or rulebook, judging guidelines, things like that, that you might get in other sports. So I mean, like, I guess the first thing to check is, do you know what I mean by the term Kong vault is that the term you're familiar with?

02-participant
That was the term I would use for a two handed, legs go through your shoulders [laughs] I'm trying to describe I mean, my legs, my shoulders, but but my weight goes on to both hands. And then my legs follow through the middle, rather than like the side or that's what I would, that's the name that I would call it. I know that some people call it a catpass as well. But generally, the Cat, Cat things tend to be a bit muddy, confused.

02-interviewer
How so?

02-participant
Well, just like what's a cat pass? And then there's a cat leap? And then there's a... Yeah, I think my memory was that the French would come over and translate things directly from the French and then we'd all be confused about what was a cat?

02-interviewer
Because it was saut de chat, in French?

02-participant
[overlap] Mm.

02-interviewer
Yeah. So I guess cat, it became catpass from that, but we generally would know it, as Kong vault.

02-participant
Yeah, because a cat leap would be leaping to a cat position, of which I've rarely seen a cat being... Yeah.

02-interviewer
[overlap] Okay.

02-participant
I would call that a kong.

02-interviewer
So I mean, you started, you started doing so already. But how would you just kind of describe that movement? In that case? The kong vault? What do you think is kind of like the, the meaningful identifying features of it?

02-participant
I think it's the even distribution of weight on both hands, shoulders coming over the hands and the hips up high. And then pulling through with those hands so that your legs follow, follow afterwards? I think I would say that's the most defining feature because taking off and landing can vary. In that you could take off two feet together, you could take off staggered, you could like you could land in any, any way really. The movement, to me is about that... The weight coming on to the hands, the hips being quite high. And then I'm thinking, what, the reason I'm stuttering a bit is I'm thinking does this sound like a dash? And it, er, cuz you know what, by saying Oh, your hands, your weights on your hands, you could, that could sound the same, but your, your shoulders and your weight is moving first rather than your, and your legs follow? As I guess a dash is your legs going first.

02-interviewer
Yeah, I mean, I'm aware, you know, I'm obviously asking you to describe something very visual. So is it, is it kind of the hands go on to the obstacle first?

02-participant
Yeah. [laughs] The hands go onto the obstacle first. And the, I would say that your hands are the thing that is the most in front of you at the beginning of the movement, and then they take your weight, er, and then your hips and legs follow. So you're leading with your hands.

02-interviewer
And what kind of, what kind of thing would you be doing that on? Does that affect the movement?

02-participant
Yeah, so, I mean, if you were doing it on a, say it tends to be on things like low walls, erm, wouldn't have to be low, but like a wall... I mean, it could be a rail. That would, would, that wouldn't really change the movement, though, apart from the use of the hand. So you might pull with the fingers more around a rail, if you've got a grip of the rail. Yeah, I mean, you can also kong... I'm trying to think now like, I would say, you could also it's not a Kong vault if you did it on the ground. But it's like a, it's actually quite a lot like a bunny hop, isn't it? Well, no, it's not because your feet go all the way through. But you could be standing on a wall and kong down to another wall. So that the thing doesn't always have to be higher than you.

02-interviewer
So this... What I find really interesting, like almost straight away, is that, like I said, the whole point of the study is kind of figuring out how do we understand these things when, when they're not written down anywhere. And as soon as I start talking to people about it. There's almost so much to the movement, it's hard to kind of reduce it to a single description. Is that... Is that something you'd agree with, or...?

02-participant
I suppose it's, I don't know. I think what it, what, what it's doing, as you asking me these questions is is making me condense more and more, what it is that is specifically the Kong part of the movement, because the thing can exist in many, er, movement can exist in multiple kinds of situations or formations. But it's only a kong when, when it's two hands, and your feet go through the middle of the space that your two hands created. Otherwise, it's something else. So I guess in a way, it what it is, is what it is not as much as anything. So if your legs go to the side, then it's some other speed vault-y thingy. So yeah, I think for knowing what it is, is partly defined by what it's not.

02-interviewer
So things kind of around that... central part of like, the two hands on the obstacle, feet coming through, can, can change and vary?

02-participant
Yeah, and I think, and perhaps the reason that it's just, I mean, this is just a theory now. But perhaps the reason that it's so clearly identifiable is it's one of the vaults, which lends itself probably the vault that lends itself most cleanly to doing a precision afterwards. Because your feet are already... there's a level of control, which if you're on the side, on the side, you're not likely to land, you're going to have to correct your positioning in order to land straight. So I think maybe that's... is that an element to why? why it's kind of clear what it is. Because it is quadraped-... quadrupedal. And in, and that's why it's called a catpass, isn't it? Because that's basically how cats leap. So that's quite easily identifiable by that.

02-interviewer
Mm. Are there, like, obviously, there can be a huge amount of these things either side of that, you know, taking off and landing, essentially. Are there like, perhaps more common things that you might see in takeoff and landings? Or is it just, it could be anything and it's that central part with the hands that is kind of what makes it a kong and everything else is open to change?

02-participant
I think everything else is open to change. There are more common things I mean, I'd say there's a, there's a jumping element to a kong a lot of the time in the takeoff, and that can either be split leg, takeoff, but that's still, it's still a jump it's just a kind of one-two type jump, or, or like just a two footed jump. And that's if, that's if the Kong is kind of in, in motion, I suppose. Yeah, if it's, if you're running into it, um, then but yeah, and also thinking how you might say you might precision somewhere or just be standing somewhere and then kong directly from where you are, that is effectively the same thing as a two footed jump into the vault. But it's a standing jump rather than running one. So yeah, so I suppose there is something in the in the takeoff is, that then a takeoff is a jump. I don't know now I'm just talking in circles. And, yeah. In terms of landing, I think [laugh] probably always land forwards. I don't think you would do a Kong and land backwards

02-interviewer
[overlap] As in you land facing the same direction you were travelling in.

02-participant
Yeah. I mean, it would be [laugh] I mean, I'm sure there's people that do it, because that's the thing now, like stuff that. I don't know what probably, I probably started parkour a couple of years after you. But I'd certainly when we started, there were loads of moves that just weren't familiar to me. I'd never seen anyone doing and now I'm just like, Whoa, a lot more creativity, um, that's happened. But yeah, I think I think in general, you'd, it is a forward moving move [laugh]

02-interviewer
Do you, um... This might be a difficult question. to really know the answer to but is that would you say that's like your definition? Not definition. Exactly. Is that is that like a description you've just come up with based on your own practice? Or is that something you think maybe you've learned from somewhere else? Is that how you were taught the movement?

02-participant
[overlap] What, the, the forward moving move?

02-interviewer
I guess the kind of hands part, like the bit that you said, kind of makes it identifiably a Kong? Did anyone ever explain that to you? So this is a Kong? Was it just just kind of something you seem to have picked up, I guess?

02-participant
Hmm. I think... I think it was something, I think it was something that was taught to me, because it was something that didn't come naturally to me. And this is also part of the reason that I was interested in your study is that my experiences of coaching were always that it was a move that came much more naturally to men than women. And that's not true of all parkour moves. So it's not just like, men are sportier. And, you know, that is something that I felt was noticeable. And I suspect it's got a lot to do with arms, you know, upper body strength and women tends to be less defined. So when beginners come with very little, sporting, kind of experience in that area, they you know, and most female sports as well don't, don't require you to, to put weight on your, on your arms in that way. And so I think it was taught to me, I can sort of, I can picture a time. I can picture a time when I don't know if it's when I first did it, or when I did it well, or something where I remember being like, yeah, I've got it. [laugh] And it was a, one of those, um, interestingly, a wobbly thing. But one of those wobbly children's toy things in a children's playground that's like it's on a giant spring and they sit on it and it kind of moves. But it was kind of broken and it didn't move very much. And it was quite low down. And I remember it being difficult to basically to trust, trust that my arms could take my weight, fully, and and it's something that has something to do with putting the putting your chest and your head forward first, as your hands go down, your head comes forward and I think that feels quite vulnerable. So, so yeah, I, I think I probably saw people doing the move, was aware that it was something that was a move people were doing and then asked to learn it. But also, you know, I was going to quite a lot of classes at the time and, and the terminology was getting used and as a way of describing how we were going to move in a space, you know, traverse this and then Kong over this, and then wall run this and then climb up however you want to, and, you know, those kind of things they, they seep in. But I remember, always, if I was scared, I would, what I always called Kong to the side, which isn't really a real Kong, in inverted commas, um, two hands, but my legs go to the side. And it took a significant amount of... it was a fear thing to trust.

02-interviewer
Can you remember what... what was causing that fear? Or what was difficult [overlap] for that movement?

02-participant
[overlap] Yeah I think, to do with, yes, throwing your body weight forwards onto your... because if you go to the side, you can, you can lift your hips kind of around rather than over, you can't really do a Kong without getting your hips high. And I remember that being something actually that some people kept saying to me, like get your hips higher, get your hips higher, which doesn't really, I never found that very helpful. Because I was like, well, I don't know how. I don't it. They don't, they're not an independent part of my body. Like, I can't sort of make them go higher. I need something a bit more helpful than that. And I remember I think Yao saying to me, think about throwing your your chest over the thing. And your hands just help you do that. And then your legs follow. And that was really helpful. And then, and then my, then my hips did get higher because my chest was trust, I guess trusting or leaning into taking my, let my, you know my hands were taking the weight in a way that... yeah.

02-interviewer
Was it becoming more of a dive, maybe?

02-participant
Yeah, probably. Yeah. Yeah, that is actually a [unclear] I'd forgotten the diving element. But yeah, I remember people talking about certainly that was like part of the vernacular, as well as some things being a dive kong.

02-interviewer
And have you, did you find when you start to move into coaching that like the maybe some of the difficulties you had, you know, you found that was common in other people or... Like, I think you might have mentioned that it was something that you found women found harder to pick up than men.

02-participant
Yeah, uh, yes, probably, I think, I think the other thing that I observed when teaching women was also the, um, there's a degree of power is required to perform the kong. And so you can't, you can't really kind of learn the Kongs slowly. I mean, you can practice jumping up onto the obstacle sort of konging up to it, but actually doing the dive part where your legs follow through and continuing, you know, continuing the flow of movement. You can't really do in slow motion. You have to, you have there's a moment of trust. And so I and I think that a lot of think women in general and this is such a this is such a generalisation. This is where I hope that I'll be anonymized. But I think women in general, in my experience, we don't, and I'm not necessarily saying that this is biological, I think it's quite possibly constructed. But we do not practice throwing our bodies around as teenagers, young, young girls in the way that many, many guys do when they say play football or they you know, I... my brothers used to put me in goal the whole time and they said I was just rubbish because I tried to always get the ball with my feet and I'd never ever dive for it. And I don't know if there is a biological element in that because we are generally potentially trying to protect the vulnerable parts of our bodies, which are, are in the centre of our bodies like they are, yeah, around our breasts, which can be really sore during puberty, or whether there's just an element where you don't throw yourself around. Because to do that would mean that you'd have to feel really confident in your body taking up space in a world, which is essentially telling you that women shouldn't take up too much space. And so there's kind of lots of lots of potential factors in there. But in general, I would say that women struggle to do that kind of diving, throwing, committing, straight off, and it takes a bit of time. And so there are multiple factors that are kind of like, at play, some of that is going to be strength stuff. But, but I think some of it is kind of having, having never really been in, in those sporting or leisure, let's say environments to enjoy that kind of throwing yourself in and not, not minding about getting injured or falling on your bum.

02-interviewer
Is it... I mean, not just for women, do you think maybe the kong is quite a scary move to do when you're starting out in general? I mean, I found it so.

02-participant
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I suppose I would say, as I'm generally naturally quite like, I don't want to go down the whole thing about like gifts and talents. But I'm from a family of sports people. And I have generally taken to sports quite well. I'd say I'm a sporty person, right. And when I came to parkour, I definitely found things... I definitely took to it. And certain things I found quite easy to say other people were struggling with. And I was like, Oh, I can fly across here. And I can do this. And you know, and I felt like, I'm quite good at this. That's my perception anyway. But I found the Kong to be something that I had to consciously overcome and learn and didn't feel that fun to learn. Because it was some it was something to, it was a challenge. So yeah, I think it is scary. Yeah, I think it is scary. And I definitely struggled - anything, I think and I think it is the diving element, you're spot on there. Because things like dive rolls as well, took me a long time to, to want to do, why would I want all of my weight in the air just catapulting towards my hands.

02-interviewer
There's an element of like trusting yourself to it, trusting that you will catch yourself or will do what you need to do.

02-participant
Yeah, I mean, the other biological element, actually, that I haven't mentioned is, is just the physicality, the the fact, of the fact that women carry more weight lower in their bodies. And so actually getting your hips higher is kind of an annoying command because my hips are quite heavy. So I'm going to need I need, you know, compared to, to some guys, especially guys, who've got big shoulders, they're carrying a lot more, a lot more of their weight a lot higher. So diving is easier. And your legs are not dragging you, dragging you back. And I'm sure there's there's advantages to having the weight lower down, possibly, actually quite probably things like balance, which women always get a good rep for being good at. Again, probably for a whole load of social, socially constructed reasons too. But, um, but yeah, your centre of gravity is lower.

02-interviewer
Yeah, so, so that kind of getting your hips up stuff. Did you find anything like that the higher the obstacle would affect that and stuff as well?

02-participant
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I would say when I was training a lot, and I was I felt like I could legit call myself a parkour practitioner [laugh] And I was like, yeah, I'm part of this community. And I still would... yeah, I think a high kong would not be something that that I'd be particularly excited about. And I don't think I ever really got that, that comfortable with, um, Kong precisions because for me, I found it really hard to pull, pull through. So this is the other part of the Kong, I think is this, you know, it's one thing to just get over the obstacle. But then the next part is the is the pulling so that you actually make distance, which I think is maybe slight, I think it probably is quite unique to a lot of other vaults, because you can't... Well, yeah, you can't really pull with any other vaults that I can think of. Which, again, is probably why it's developed to be the one that people use when you know, if they're precisioning to something else afterwards

02-interviewer
Do feel that gives it a utility that other movements might not have? Because it...

02-participant
I suppose I'm not really sure what utility I mean, is any of this, like... they're all just movements, right?

02-interviewer
I guess, um... You know, we, there's always options for getting from A to B or whatever you're doing in parkour, is it, is there like something unique to the kong? Or is it just popular?

02-participant
[overlap] I see what you mean. You know, right. Yeah, I think it also looks, it looks impressive, right? And I guess that goes hand in hand with the fact that your average Joe doesn't, if so, if you want to like vault a fence, and you're quite a sporty person, and you've never really given it much thought, you're not going to do a Kong, like you're going to do a kind of either a sort of step vault-y thing, or I don't really know what you call a step forward without a step, but a side-y...

02-interviewer
Just swing yourself over. Yeah.

02-participant
You just swing yourself over. Yeah, you're not going to put throw your legs between, you're not going to dive over it. So, so I think there's an element to which the kong looks like something that, that an average person doesn't do. So it looks cool. And I think it's very elegant. It's, it, you are kind of there's a there's a flying element in, in the motion. And there is a moment of trust where your body flies before your hands hit. And then, and then on. So, so yeah, I think it's popular for that, but yeah, I see what you mean about the utility, it's popular also, because it has more flexibility in terms of what you can do on the other side, once you've done the vault.

02-interviewer
And I think you mentioned this earlier, I made a note of it. You were talking about how it's perhaps kind of very well suited to going into a precision. Is that, you know, what, what do you think, lends itself to that? Or to that kind of thing, is it... I guess, if you're coming out the other side of a kong, you know, what, what is? What is different about it? Or is there is there anything different?

02-participant
So your weight is centred, you're like, your hips are centred, they're not like on a, an angle, or skew. So when you see the place you want to precision to, like the destination as you get, you know, over, you haven't got to readjust your positioning, you just got to focus on where your feet are landing. And I think it's probably also this pulling thing, this the fact that you can pull with your hands to make that adjustment, um, for how far you go, or something. I mean, if you're... I'm just trying to think of other vaults now, I mean, it's also speed, right? Like that... A turn vault is slow, and can look nice, but it's you kind of land on the other side and you're facing the other way. You're not moving, moving on. So so there's a kind of there's a fluidity which, which was certainly really attractive when, when I started parkour that that that felt like it was always the goal, was to create fluid lines. Now that seems like there's so much more I don't really care what's parkour and what's like acrobatics, but you know like there's so much more flourishing I suppose of movement, um, but I think the Kongs endured because it's just quite impressive, it looks, it's like an acrobatic move because there's a moment of flight which when when exaggerated into you know people Kong like huge distances now they double Kong and stuff just looks like something a human wouldn't wouldn't be able to do.

02-interviewer
Mm. And it's quite, um, it's quite like a uniquely parkour movement.

02-participant
Yeah, it's not it's, I don't, it's not in gymnastics it's not in... yeah, I can't, it's not part of athletics either, it's not like hurdling or long jump or any of those other things that, or high jump, it's, it's quite uniquely... I think there's something as well, uh, maybe this is because I'm old school, but something about overcoming obstacles, which the kong when executed cleanly and smoothly, feels like, here's a massive wall, and I just glided over it. And that I think that's, that's, that was the kind of... that was definitely in within the parkour culture that I was gonna say, grew up in that I did, I grew myself in. But yeah, within that parkour culture, there was definitely, it was about overcoming obstacles, whether they were mental or physical. And doing so with control, power and grace. That was the kind of goal.

02-interviewer
I'm just gonna put my light on, because it's getting a bit dark. Sorry. Yeah. Okay. That's really, really interesting, really useful to... As I say, part of the, part of the study is to just talk to people about how they've kind of come to understand the Kong, just from being around parkour essentially seems to be the way that people just pick these things up. So I guess when you, when you kind of started going into coaching, you know, we've already talked a little bit about the people that maybe found it difficult or, and the reasons why. But was it something that... Actually, I guess, sorry, just to go back a second, is it like something that's important to try and learn? When you're doing parkour? Do you think? Is it something that is like an important part of parkour? Or is it just another movement?

02-participant
Well, it's a good question, actually. Because I think I said, I certainly never had anyone say to me, these are the fundamentals of parkour. And once you have mastered them, you're a parkour person or anything like that. But I think there was an unwritten kind of, perhaps, yeah, perhaps a bit of a dictionary of movements that, that you... needed to be able to do or something? I don't know. So I'm thinking specifically, like, you could, you could train with anybody. And by, you know, you and me would have a very different arm jump capability, my memory of you is that you just do massive arm jumps. And I would, like, be wondering why. And, but I always felt like you seemed very confident in your upper body strength. And so that felt like you knew that you would catch yourself in that way. So we could we could train together and it would be fine that I can't do that cat leap that's too big for me. But I didn't, just try and try to put my finger on it. That wasn't a move that when I was training, a lot that I couldn't do in some other controlled environment, really, within our kind of the culture of our, of the people that I was training with, nobody was doing front flips, no one was doing corks or whatever they're called [laughs]. Um, there was a, there was a kind of what's the word I'm trying? I'm saying like, I want to say movement vocabulary, but it's more like a box of tools. They were like a box of tools. And, and... [unclear]

02-interviewer
So is it like, a kind of fundamental?

02-participant
Maybe? Yeah, of sort of toolbox of proficiencies. And yeah, there'd be kind of... I certainly felt, maybe I, maybe I just internal, like, maybe I made this up. But I suspect that I internalised it from the culture was that I wasn't really doing parkour, I wasn't really a member of the gang until I had sort of mastered these fundamentals.

02-interviewer
Kind of like, I really like what you said, like an unwritten [unclear], because that's the whole, the whole thesis. But somehow, that's still kind of understood, communally, that like, there's this list of, not exactly this, but there's this like, group of fundamentals, I guess, that are like, parkour techniques. And that's what people are kind of coaching, essentially.

02-participant
Yeah. And I think I would, yes, you're right. And I think there will be things that I found, like, I always found palm spins, challenging. And I remember, and I used to go to Archway where there was a kind of slopey bit. And I just drilled them until I could do them. And then I could do them on any wall anywhere. And that felt really important. At the time, I remember being like, I need, I need that. Because now and I need that to be in my... in my toolbox. And there's also a thing in this about mastering something as well, where you can't just have done it a few times, you have to be able to do it wherever, as long as it's within your strength capability, the technique, you have to be able, you have to have, if that makes sense.

02-interviewer
But like you say no one, no one ever just came out and said that these are the things you have to learn. It just seemed to have kind of-...

02-participant
No. Yeah, and it's odd, because I remember when people started coming, well, when the Chainstore was built, and people started coming back from Gerlev, with, with loads of lache stuff. And me being like, Oh shit, I need to get good at laches now, because this is it's a new, it's a new thing on the toolbox. Before there was all the scaffolding people weren't really doing laches and maybe kind of like swing a little bit. But suddenly, laches became like a big deal, as did the thing where you know, the kind of gymnastics muscle up followed by the legs on the side swing through lark, which, which all felt like new, new tools that were needed in order to, to, I suppose it's in order to to have full range of creativity and in the changing environment, which is essentially what what happened at that time in Parkour is, more and more people were getting really fed up with us in their, in their housing estates. And we were starting to, and the movements were starting to adapt to purpose built spaces. But yeah, it was... it was, I mean, it was completely unwritten like nobody... no one ever, I think, I think I might have a book actually, that someone gave me which is like about parkour that, which I think Dan might even have written.

02-interviewer
[overlap] I think I had that.

02-participant
It had what he called like the basics, and I'm pretty sure a Kong would have been a basic thing. But I can remember very specifically all the things which I felt were part of the toolbox, but which were harder for me to achieve like palm spins, and kong pres, so like a kong pre to a rail. I think I probably did, like 20 times in my whole life. I really avoided them. It's what just went, when, were a struggle for me and like flick ups from a rail, on a rail and things like that where they really, it's technical.

02-interviewer
So it's that...

02-participant
The fear can get in the way of developing the technique.

02-interviewer
Just what you said about like Kongs to rail precisions. So that kind of thing is it... You know, it's obviously all very individual, your parkour practice. Your... so when you're doing a Kong, how do you kind of judge for yourself? Whether it's, I guess, essentially just a good Kong or a bad Kong? Like how, or when you're coaching, how do you? How do you kind of assess it as a movement? What do you what might you be looking for?

02-participant
I think the fluidity of the movement. And there's an fluidity and control, which is usually measured in the, the softness of the landing. And, I mean, that was definitely a prized thing in and our, like, parkour culture, which is interesting, because it's, it's not universally, you know, that kind of incredibly quiet landings, and super control on on the balls of the feet type thing, which, which is, you know, essentially a marker of how, of how controlled you were in the movement. But there, there's like a sweet spot, I think between between con, control, and, and the fluidity of the movement and the speed. If you can combine the two, then it means that you've got power with control, I suppose. I feel like I'm, I've turned into Blane [laughs] Yeah, power, without control.

02-interviewer
It's almost impossible to talk about parkour techniques without saying that at least once.

02-participant
Yeah, so I think I think that would determine if it was a good kong. There's something else that I thought of actually, when, just just before you asked me that question, felt significant. [pause] Let's go on, you'll probably come back something about strength that I can't remember.

02-interviewer
Well, interrupt me if it pops back into your head. So I think some of the things that, you know, I guess, if you were to just look at, watch someone doing a Kong, it's tempting to start with doing just kind of assessing in terms of like, well, how far did they go? Or how fast did they do it? Do you think those kinds of things ultimately matter? Or are they just results of the controls that you were talking about before? Like, are they goals in themselves?

02-participant
I don't think that I would ever look at someone doing a kong and think, oh, that was very slow, or, you know, or, and judge it in that way. And, you know, it's tempting to say, Oh, we don't judge each other's movements, in parkour. It's all about your own journey. But that's just not true. You know, there, there is a marker. There are some people that move in a certain way, which is, which is seems better. And I think it's, there's a confidence I think that perhaps, although that's not very measurable, but I've got two people doing the move in my head as I talk to you. One is somebody that I taught to kong in Bristol, actually, when I first moved here, and was kind of trying to find parkour friends. There was a girl who had been to the women's annual women's PK Gen gathering a couple of times. But she'd never had anyone to train with she just had YouTube videos. And she... yeah, she, I taught her to Kong and her Kongs were just so hesitant. And the there was, it was like, her movement, she, she had no confidence that the movement was going to execute itself well. And so that's what I've got in my head when I'm thinking of a bad kong because it was kind of slow, scrappy, and tense. Maybe there's something in there that tension, and then I've got someone like [name] and most of his movements, in general, they're just so fluid. There's, it looks quite effortless, um, and it's very precise.

02-interviewer
Is there anything you- sorry-...

02-participant
[unclear] No go on.

02-interviewer
Is there anything you can kind of put your finger on in perhaps like [name] as an example, then, that kind of conveys that? Or is it just more of a, an overall impression? I mean, even, even really granular things like, oh, he, I dunno, he hit, hits the obstacle with his hands really quietly or maintain speed or, or it just looks nice, like...?

02-participant
Um, so there's no, mark, the beginning, middle, and end of the execution of the movement has a there's like, equal effort in all parts of it. So it doesn't appear to be like, I want to put that into words for you [laugh] It doesn't look like there's a huge amount of energy and effort being expended at the moment of lifting off or impact or pulling or anything like that. It all looks like one fluid movement that requires the same amount of effort. And I think that, that would be something. You mentioned the hands. Yeah, definitely. No slapping or heaviness. So it seems really light. And I think that I think there is something in this tension thing, I think, potentially, his face and his neck seem at ease in the movement. You know, those I can sort of when I think about doing a difficult kong, I can almost picture myself going like, nngh, like really tensing to try and exert a lot of, of energy and power. And that being a strain. So yeah, I think there's something about good movement, which is seemingly effortless.

02-interviewer
And is that to bring it back around to coaching, is that something you would try and convey in coaching?

02-participant
It's very interesting. No, I don't think so. I although I think we, we would often, so the symptom of, of something being lots of effort, or the indicator is often that it's, it is often the sound, it sounds heavy, it you know, it feels heavy, like if your hands are sore, then you're obviously slapping down in a way that's not, not so, you're listening to your body and how you're landing. So we, I think the coaching side of things would always be focusing on those, those elements, and it works back so that the quieter you're able to land, the chances are, the more controlled you're being. But, you know, I never said, hm. I dunno, I might have said in in a coaching scenario, think about this, don't worry too much about the speed of this route, but focus on being like water in the route, or some kind of image that would convey fluidity. And often, you know, with coaching, you might focus on a, on a particular thing. So we want this route to be like the most dynamic, powerful, fast thing you've ever done. Or, actually, we want it to be really clean and tight and really pay attention to details. So people, people practice those different elements and with the idea that hopefully the two things can maybe marry up. Yeah.

02-interviewer
Were there any, um, I mean, it might be difficult to answer that because it's been a while but were there any like common coaching tools or coaching cues that you would use for the Kong? Would it just be a case of demonstrating it or...?

02-participant
Yeah, so if someone's struggling, quite if it was a wall, probably not on a rail, it's a bit harder on a rail, but it was a wall or something, quite often break it down to Konging up to your feet, and then pushing them through. So, yeah. Do you want me to explain that better?

02-interviewer
No no, I know what you mean. Yeah, like, um-

02-participant
I'm not sure when you're transcribing it, whether you need to whether as long as you know what it means it's fine, or whether you need the data to actually explain what I mean.

02-interviewer
No, as long as I understand it, it should be okay. I interpret it, when I analyse it.

02-participant
Okay, so jumping two feet up, and then, and then the land and landing those feet, and then then jumping them off. But with your hands still on and pulling through, and then just practice and then grazing, essentially grazing your feet through until the point where you maybe don't need to lift, don't need to jump anymore. So that'd be kind of, I am fairly sure I taught a lot of, a lot of women to do that. And probably guys, too, but I think, and I don't know whether this is a gender thing as well but I don't remember any guy, any blokes needing Kong instruction, possibly because they went home and taught themselves and didn't want me to show them. Who knows, but I don't know. Anyway, moving on from that. Yes. Um, other things that I would teach people, yeah, just this thing of pushing the chest forward. Because it really, really helped me to think of, of me of throwing the chest over. And I kind of it's quite a visual thing. But the kong, it's not, it's not about getting up and over is almost about going through. I remember, I think it was Yao telling me that like, think of yourself as, as you're doing the takeoff, you're going through, not up and then down. Because when you're trying to go up, you're think and you're using your hands, you're not, your hips are going to stay down, really. Whereas if you're going through, you're kind of imagining yourself going flat, and then your hips are going to be in you know, higher up and in line to go over. The other thing that I definitely had, did a lot of coaching on was the two footed take off. I think that can be challenging for people. I don't remember learning that myself. Maybe it was something that came kind of easier to me. I don't know, but I do remember coaching that and thinking about it in this one two, way.

02-interviewer
Do you mean the split foot?

02-participant
Yeah. What did I call it?

02-interviewer
You just said two foot.

02-participant
Sorry. Yeah. Split foot. Yeah, cuz because initially, I think someone said to me oh, you know, you're just running and then you jump. And I was like, but that doesn't translate to most people. You don't as you're running. You don't. Otherwise that's, that's a leap. And you know, a jump off one foot is a leap. So yeah, so the idea of planting two feet, but being split is something that I remember coaching quite a lot.

02-interviewer
Did you find the rhythm of it, I have really strong memories of someone trying to teach me the rhythm of that, like, yeah, 1-1-2.

02-participant
Yeah, yes. Yeah, and I think I think it was one, and-two, for me in my head

02-interviewer
[overlap] Yeah, something like that, yeah.

02-participant
Like, so it's your last thing and then, and-two, and off you go. Yeah, no, I definitely I can feel it. Like, in my body as I'm talking about it what you do. Yeah. And that I think there was a kind of there was a bit of a st- status-y thing around that, like you wanted to be able to split foot. That was some, and maybe that's because it's slightly harder. I don't know. But also, I think it's because you can do it, because it looks smoother. So actually coming back to this thing about fluidity, it does look smoother than running, running, running, boing, on two feet, it kind of flows into, into movement. So in a hierarchy of like Kong niceness, that and then yeah, what are the other coaching points? Yeah, I think just, just being, reminding people that you're going to have to look over the, over it in a way you don't have to do when you're doing a side, step vault or something you have to lead with your with your chest and your head. Um, and trust, trust that you're gonna get, you're gonna be okay. Um, yeah, I mean, I can't, I can't remember how many people said to me like, pull pull pull. And I never really... I mean, I know I did pull a bit, otherwise I wouldn't have got as far as I did. But I never really felt like I mastered that, that feeling of a feeling like I've got enough extra pull, that's not, that different to the momentum I got from the takeoff to really go any distance.

02-interviewer
So did you feel like your, your arms, your upper body was just kind of re-orientating you, in space, kind of just to get you over the obstacle, but it wasn't really contributing to the distance you were going or anything?

02-participant
Yeah, so just pulling me across the obstacle rather than anything extra, that was, um...

02-interviewer
But people were kind of saying that, you know, the arms were supposed to give you extra distance?

02-participant
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that was particularly, you know, in view of doing kong precisions to a place that seemed further than I could get to. I think, you know, and a lot of those things, you, you look at a thing, and then the people that you know, you well, that are training with you, are just, I don't understand why you can't get there. Like, you should be able to, it doesn't seem that far for you, like, I know, you're strong. So I'd imagine there's, there was a technical element for me that, that I hadn't worked out in my body, how to get that extra pull.

02-interviewer
So it was technique, technique over strength. It's not just brute strength gets you through.

02-participant
I think there's probably an element of strength in there. But I was also quite strong. Back in the day [laugh] Yeah. Or, you know, there would be, or I would compare myself to people of a similar sort of strength to me, or, and similar physicality to me. Know, a lot of the time I in other strength areas, I'd be stronger, for example, than Kasturi,  but then she could always kong further than me. So then I would be like, well, what's what am I doing wrong? What's going on? But there's, there was never really enough understanding, I don't think within the community of, there would really be only a few basic, basic coaching commands, which are like pull more, you know. And actually, those were kind of, even though people did record stuff, people didn't film with their phones, anything like what they do now. I mean, the process of me learning to handstand and headstand, I film myself constantly, and I'm always looking at my technique, I probably would have done that, then I would probably do that now if I learnt a Kong and be looking at what was going on and be like, Oh, I see what I'm doing. I'm pulling back at that last moment, or I'm, blah, blah, blah. We didn't, I didn't do any of that stuff. I didn't film myself. I filmed things, because they were like, impressive. But I wouldn't film stuff to learn about myself in it.

02-interviewer
Yeah. It's kind of felt like it was, um. There was like a conventional wisdom, wisdom to these things that was just kind of passed on. But it wasn't, you couldn't ever really say for sure, it's 100%, true. It's just that's what worked for someone else.

02-participant
Yeah. Yeah. Which is why I think, um, I think sometimes it was very useful. It's been very useful for me to be coached by people who've struggled with certain moves. And so I think, I think I was quite good Kong coach, because I had to break it down for me and work out what the fear was about. Whereas, people, I mean, I remember being coached about a kong by somebody, a male coach, who was like, just gotta commit, you know, and that wasn't very helpful. And, you know, you just got to commit doesn't really apply when it's a technique you've never done before, and you don't know what it's going to feel like, because what you're essentially saying is just throw yourself into this unknown. And when it's a move where you're leading with your head, it's, yeah, it's got to, it's gonna take a lot of commitment to really go for it, because you could seriously hurt yourself.

02-interviewer
Yeah.

02-participant
Especially, you know, I mean, my fear with Kongs. I haven't talked about that. But my fear was always that I'd clip my foot. I'm not getting my foot high enough, clip my foot on the obstacle, and then just go, like just land on my head. Which I've never seen happen, actually, of all the thing. No, I think, have you done that?

02-interviewer
I did that. I did that on my, like, third class or something. And it haunted me for a long time.

02-participant
Okay, so it's possible. I mean, I wasn't there, but now I can see it. And I think...

02-interviewer
Maybe I shouldn't have told you that, maybe I'm not doing you any favours by verifying this [laugh]

02-participant
I know [laugh] I think a lot of the things that I'm scared of now are things that I've seen going wrong that I that that now I kind of can't unsee. But I think as well, you know, I'm getting older now. So my body doesn't quite bounce back the way that used to. Yeah. Went down into a dark hole there.

02-interviewer
Yes, the inevitability of old age and decline. Yeah. I'm aware of the time, I don't want to monopolise your evening too much. That's kind of we've kind of covered pretty much all the main points that I try and aim for with these things. It's been really interesting. Is there anything that you you kind of want to add just at the end, or anything that's popped into your head, that we haven't had a chance to get to?

02-participant
I don't think so. I found it really interesting. I feel kind of I feel quite fired up now to go and do some parkour, but I-

02-interviewer
Oh, good.

02-participant
But my wrist consultant would be like, what the hell? Why is she back so soon?

02-interviewer
[laugh] Blame me.

02-participant
I mean, if there's any other. I mean, I've got another 10 minutes before my partner comes downstairs and demands dinner. So if you've got anything, go for it.

02-interviewer
I mean, the only thing I'm kind of I've been asking people is just for yourself. Is there anything about the movement that you are curious about that you'd like to know more about? Or, you know, some of the coaching things to try and other things that you think I'd actually really like to find out if this is correct or not?

02-participant
Not if it's correct or not? Because I don't know if I think of movement in that way.

02-interviewer
Yeah, I don't, I don't mean, I'm not trying to be like prescriptive, to movement. I mean, it's more of like, some of the coaching cues, whether they actually were useful to people.

02-participant
Yeah, I mean, I'd love to hear if get your hips higher ever, ever helped anybody? Because that's what it's kind of, for me that coaching cue is always so unhelpful. Because that I suppose if I'd watched a video of myself, I probably would have been like, Oh, my hips are really low. But the mechanics of movement meant that I can't, he can't just sort of lift them up. They don't go up. Something else kind of needs to go down for them to come up. And the reason that they were down is because all the weight was, all my gravity, or, you know, my bum was heavy, and I needed to weight to be somewhere further forward. So yeah, be interesting if that ever worked for anyone, but I think mostly, and I probably am quite curious about this pulling thing. Because it's an area where I just, I just never really felt like I made a lot of progress. And I think like most of us within parkour, you know, you find the movement within the kind of broader vocabulary of the set of movements that you need to have in order to be part of the gang. And, you know, there's some which which you are naturally drawn to which your body just feels good doing. And that wasn't one that particularly felt like that for me. So I just never really trained it, which then becomes a self fulfilling thing, right? Like, you never get much better because you didn't train it. Yeah, I'd be quite interested to know what the mechanics, in a way of like when people are pulling and, and what are they... I know they're pulling with their arms, but what strength enables that because it may well be that, yeah, we're strong  at x, y, z, but I wasn't really strong in my, I don't know, pecs or traps or whatever. That is where the real dynamic part of the movement comes from so yeah, that'd be quite interesting, for me.

02-interviewer
Mm. It's, it's a shame. One of the things that I wanted to initially do with this research I haven't been able to do because of COVID, you know, the University shut down. And I can't do in person testing. But I was going to build a vaulting box with a force platform built into the top. So I could actually measure, a force platform force. So it's a platform, it's actually remarkably similar to my mouse trackpad. And it can detect the pressure and how much force people are pushing down on it with. And it's usually used for jumping and like, you know, you land on it with the feet. But I wanted to build it into a vaulting box and see what people's hands were doing. But, you know, hopefully, if this study goes well, I can then use it as justification to, to do that next one. So it's very heartening to hear someone else say that they're curious about that as well.

02-participant
Yeah, I'd say yeah, I'll come and I'll come and do some Kongs for you.

02-interviewer
If your wrist is okay, of course.

02-participant
Yeah. No. I mean, if it's, yeah, now, I should be more careful. I do this thing. Oh, but it's really, it's gonna be really fun. It's just one day. I'm sure it'll be fine. Yeah.

02-interviewer
Well, as long as you sign the form that says you're healthy.

02-participant
Yeah, okay. Sure.

02-interviewer
I shouldn't have put that on video. Cool. All right. Well, yeah, unless there's anything else you can think of to add, I'll stop the recording.

02-participant
Yeah, I think that's it. Just know, maybe just want to say to that. I've really enjoyed thinking about it in this way. And, and yeah, it's, it's made me think about the, yeah, the level to which things were just being passed down. And how this kind of coaching culture emerged without any real sort of theory behind the coaching points. Yeah, it's kind of like, oh, we're gonna pass this thing on, but there wasn't really any. Yeah, this collective wisdom ideas really interesting, I never thought about it that way. But quite empowering, too, because I think whatever. Whatever works for you, as a, as a practitioner, could be something that you then use to coach somebody else. So there's this kind of lived experience element that feels quite valuable within the community.

02-interviewer
It becomes a balancing act, because anything anecdotal like that, you can really use that to go on and coach someone else well, provided that what worked for you works for them. Yeah. But then the thing you have to avoid is people making generalisations that then they start trying to coach people and then it becomes, well, it's your fault, because the coach is not working for you rather than there's something wrong with the coaching. But that's, that's where things like national governing bodies would come in. But then we need to make sure that the national governing body is actually representing the sport. It's all, it's all very open at the moment. But, you know, one of the reasons I'm doing this study. Cool. I'll stop the recording.
