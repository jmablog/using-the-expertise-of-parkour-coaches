18-interviewer
Okay, there we go. So, yeah, as a, as we kind of went through the study is just kind of talking about how some of the movements in parkour have, have kind of spread, how people have come to understand them in their own various ways, and how they coach them to other people as well. And I picked the Kong vault as just a particularly well known movement. So I guess the first thing to kind of start with is, is Kong vault the term familiar to you? Or do you call it something else?

18-participant
When I very very first started I think I called it Kong vault, but then I like transitioned into catpass, as I was, like, trying to be a bit more respectful to the, you know, the original name of it.

18-interviewer
Was that, was that just something you felt like doing? Or is that something you felt other people were doing as well?

18-participant
I think I may have seen posts on dot net, parkour dot net about it or something like that. And I think, you know, I saw the terms first on urban free flow or something, and so it just, I also came from kind of like a martial arts background. So I guess there was like, this idea of like, trying to be respectful to like the ones that came before you, you know, and so it was just like an attempt at this, I suppose.

18-interviewer
So you use the term catpass now?

18-participant
Yeah, catpass, sometimes Kong vault, but it's it's interchangeable I don't, you know. Yeah.

18-interviewer
Do you- I'll try and I'll try and use catpass for the interview. Just for consistency. But yeah, I'll probably slip up because I've called it Kong Vault for 12 years now. Which is weird to think about.

18-participant
Yeah, that makes sense. Like, as I started learning, like, I'm in Turkey, right? I'm not Turkish, obviously. But like, you know, when my wife and I are talking, you'll end up being like a Turk-lish sometimes, you know what I mean? And I think it's, similarly if you're training with people that use different terminology, I find it's originally I was like, Oh, we should all like have a unified something or other. And I'm sure that would be helpful. But it's also like, I think, maybe it's good for the brain to like, just know, like, this might be what this thing is called. And you could just understand it immediately. You know, like, you know, elma is another word for apple in Turkish. So I don't think of like, Oh, okay. Elma means apple, I'm like, ah elma's like this thing, apple's this thing, too. It's just, you know, catpass, Kong, whatever, it's the same thing.

18-interviewer
And so, just to kind of start us off then, how would you describe a catpass? Very broad question.

18-participant
Yeah, it's a good one, I need to think about this. For me, a catpass is a linear vault where you're travelling, you know, forward, generally, perpendicular with an obstacle and the idea is to kind of have a symmetrical push with your hands, and tuck with your knees to pass over it, the legs don't usually pass through, you're kind of blocking your body and counter balancing to fly over it. Like a kind of a tuck.

18-interviewer
So the hands come out onto the obstacle first?

18-participant
Yeah. So you'll reach hands first into the obstacle, and you kind of start to jump, then lift the hips up, then you'll push with your arms as you tuck. So it kind of let that combination of movements boost you over the obstacle.

18-interviewer
So you mentioned there that the, I can't remember if you said feet or legs, but they don't come through the hands. Does that mean like the hands come off the obstacle and your whole body just travels over?

18-participant
Yeah, generally, you know, people, when they see the movement, they seem to get that feeling that like, okay, I can't do it, you know, if my feet can't get through my hands, but if anything, I feel like the only thing that maybe passes through that vertical line of where your hands are posted, would be you know, your knees before you're lifting off of the obstacle. So and you're in way more of like, like a tucked planche kind of position than any kind of squatting, you know, like the kash vault you know, where you would actually need to be able to get your, your legs through. So, if you're feeling like your feet have to get through before your hands are lifted I think it's making the movement, not harder but, I mean, harder for me for sure [laugh] but you know, it's making it a little bit different as well.

18-interviewer
So are the, are the arms or the hands pushing on the obstacle as well?

18-participant
Yeah, it's like a combination of pull and push. I used to focus way more on the pull when I started and I then a friend of mine, Pedro as a co-worker when I was working in Dubai and I could see he focused a little bit more on the push. And I saw that had like, this combination of that this push and this lift is like I think super useful for getting power in  variable circumstances, you know, like on a wall, maybe you can get a real good pull or at a bar if you're standing. But if you're like running at a bar, you know, you don't really have that same ability.

18-interviewer
What, what's kind of the difference between push and pull in the movement? How does it affect it?

18-participant
I see. For me, I found that the push helps me better transfer my run. So when I'm starting to go for more maximal distances for me, my worry isn't so much as I don't worry as much about getting a really, really good pull, and then transferring into the push, I start to worry more about having a very smooth transition of momentum from my run into my push, if that makes sense.

18-interviewer
So are you the pushing, by push versus pull, like push down onto the obstacle to go up?

18-participant
For me, yeah, exactly. Pushing down on the obstacle, it's like the most most akin to like a push up type movement, literally, where you're pushing more towards the front of your body. And then what I consider more of a pull would be like, like a front lever kind of movement, where you're going from overhead, because you're leaned down, you know, towards that obstacle, and you're bringing the obstacle kind of in front of you and underneath you is what I would consider more pulling. So it's, you know, that was, I guess, using more lat kind of involvement, versus this push is really, you know, triceps pecs, biceps kind of stuff. 

18-interviewer
So, do you still use the pull at all? Would, or are you just all about push now?

18-participant
No, 100%, I think the one thing that I'm kind of big on is like, the there's, you know, the maximal effective technique, if you're trying to get distance, in this case, for a catpass is gonna look different depending on the speed that you're entering, you know, if you're, if you're doing a standing catpass, or, you know, just the split foot, you're gonna need to rely on different aspects of your body to give you that, to give you that, that momentum and that power. And so I feel like, for me, if I'm on the more static end of the spectrum, as far as the moments and that I have before the catpass, I might rely more on the pull. And then as my speed prior to the catpass starts to increase, I might start to rely more on the push.

18-interviewer
So the pull can kind of generate some some power for travelling? If you are, if you haven't got that from from your run up?

18-participant
Yeah, I think so. It helps me get that initial, you know, launch forward into it. I then can push down into the obstacle and block over it as I as I tuck, you know.

18-interviewer
I mean, you started to talk about takeoffs a bit there. Are there particular ways to take off for the movement?

18-participant
Yeah, I think there's a lot of ways, for me, I guess the three main ways I would say is punch, which is jumping off two feet, kind of like a plyo, a technical plyo, not like a physical exercise plyo. The split foot, which I find closest to like, a hurdle in gymnastics, or a gallop, which is like a one sided skip. And then the last one that I see the least but it still exists is like just a straight running stride. You don't do any, you know, like a one foot takeoff kind of thing. Obviously, there's others, there's step ups, and you can tac into it or you can, whatever, there's so many different ways, but I think those are like, from the ground the three kind of classic, or most common ways I would say.

18-interviewer
Yeah, there's always gonna be like, wild variations on every, on everything, right?

18-participant
Yeah. And even variations inside it, you know, like the same for , one of my friends is a gymnast. And seeing his plyo is way more like the classic exercise one because he's hitting the hell out of the ground as he's used to a springboard, you know, whereas, even when I plyo it's, I'm trying to be soft, you know, I'm not smashing into the ground because I'm not used to being on something springy, I'm used to being on the ground. So even that can change. I, I've seen people split foot, you know, hybrid split foot plyo, or use way more kick in their split foot, you know [unclear]

18-interviewer
Do those, perhaps more with the, like, more common ones that you mentioned, rather than worrying about all the edge cases, are there, how do they kind of affect the movement? If they do?

18-participant
Um, I think, you know, Parkour is kind of cool in that you can always you know, if you have those little, my sister in law has like a little kid now so watching her do puzzles and stuff like that, you know, there's like, can't fit like a square peg in a round hole or something like this. And I feel like there's a lot of times where you can, you can cheat a bit and get, you know, what you want, but from different techniques, but for me, like the split foot is, ends up being kind of the most bang for your buck take off, kind of like the pareto principle, if takeoffs were 80%, of what you want to do with the catpass, maybe can be done with this, with this split foot, which is why it's it's useful to to learn, I think, but I think when I was younger, I kind of attributed the split foot with, since it's a smoother transition from run into the vault, it's better for getting like distance. And then I would use the plyo, or, you know, the punch, if I was trying to go up on something higher. But I find these days, I'm mostly sticking with a split foot or doing like, a split foot plyo, where I'm not heel driving as much as I might for a normal split foot. But that being said, you know, if you're doing a running jump into a catpass, you're generally going to be taking off two feet, just like the punch. So I think both are both are useful, depending on the purpose of it. If I'm connecting in a kind of dense area, or after a precision or for rails, you know, I'm not, you're not split footing on a rail pretty easily. So it's generally going to be that punch take off. And then if I'm on the, if I'm doing something that I'm able to take off on the ground, or you know, a decent enough wall, then it's gonna be a split foot.

18-interviewer
And is that because it's just kind of blends that forward motion into the movement easier?

18-participant
Yeah, I think it has been way, way more gentle, exactly, you illustrated it perfectly, a gentle sort of acceleration or transference of that momentum, rather than a potentially abrupt, you know, angular shift.

18-interviewer
And how about on the other side of the obstacle? Are there particularly common ways to land from it? Or, you started to mention connecting it to other movements as well?

18-participant
Yeah, I think I mean, I think two foot landing is a great starter. So you know, if somebody was doing catpass, I would have them start with that, obviously, not start with that. But if they're actually clearing the, you know, the catpass, already, they would just have them land precision, since it's a potentially safer, more stable place, you know, and then after that, you know, they'd start to run out of it, and I kind of think of it, there's, I had a funny, I don't know if it's a compensation, but a funny habit, where we did like an endurance challenge, where we were doing 50 different movements of seven different movements or something like this. And when we got to the catpasses, I was like, being real sure to switch up which foot I was split footing with every single time, so that I would just not fatigue one side of my body more than the other. But I still noticed about halfway through, I was like, my left leg is like, hella tired, what's going on, you know, I'm just unknowingly, even though I was switching my entry my, my landing was left foot stepping out every single time. And so, you know, making sure to, you know, years and years ago, but, you know, I think it's good to to be ambidextrous in that. And that's too, you know, ease the load. So, I think stepping out in stride, and precision are probably the classic ones. And then, second from that, if I'm going, if I'm stepping out of it, I find theres kind of like two ways that I'll generally step out of it. One is I'll keep one knee higher, and just go out of it running. And then the second one is, as I'm exiting it'll be more similar to that stride where one foot or swing through, one foot reaches down while the non-landing leg reaches behind so that as soon as the landing foot makes contact, I can kick through into a jump or keep my momentum going. And I feel like it really lessens the impact on the single leg takeoff. So if I have the space or the momentum, this is the one I generally like to go with.

18-interviewer
Is it quite an impactful landing from a kong vault, perhaps in comparison to other vaults?

18-participant
I would say so, I think it's probably one of the most dynamic, what's it called, dynamic basic vaults that we have, you know, the only one that I personally feel like I get higher on is, is like my reverse vaults sometimes. So what I'm kind of thinking of, in respects to impact in this case is like, where are my hips in relation to the ground or the place that I'm landing? And then also, you know, how dynamic is the movement, something like a step vault, your hips get to stay really low. And you can see that we don't have to have any amount of dynamism or I don't know what to say, to the amount of, you know, speed into your landing. But for the catpass, you know, if you're doing your catpass, like, you might be an arm's length away from, you know, the obstacle, then you might get some lift after that, and then you're having to take that landing, you know, as well. So I think it's probably one of the most dynamic, impactful landings that there couldn't be.

18-interviewer
Does that make it potentially harder to come out of it with like a single leg landing compared to some other vaults? And so maybe connect it to other movements?

18-participant
Yeah, I think, just from my experience, doing it and teaching it, I would say so. But that being said, I feel like you know, most people get the get the hang of one kind of way, sooner or the other, but the two foot way tends to be the natural, you know, the first one, the first one, but is that the natural one, because most of the time when people teach they're teaching precision jumps, so they're locking in this landing technique, you know, I've never had a student when I said, I'm not going to teach them precisions or landing catpass, then I'm just going to teach them and have it stepping out. Sometimes I've seen people do it naturally. But you know, more often than not, it's that two foot kind of stability landing. And I think that is a piece of it does have some more impact. Not a lot, but.

18-interviewer
You're kind of coming off the obstacle, and you're just in midair, almost as if you are doing that precision, you don't have that limb kind of behind you lowering you down, like you're do in some, even something like a dash vault, to a degree.

18-participant
Yeah, exactly. 100%. Yeah, that dash vault, you can, even when you're powering into it, the momentum is kind of hitting different, you know, I feel like if you're doing the catpass itself, it's kind of like, you're getting this dip and then this lift after it. Whereas with the dash, I feel like you're, you can still get a lot of power from that movement. But because your hips are still low, you know what I mean? If you think of, for a dash versus the catpass, what gives you... your hips start low, and then that explosive hip extension, lifts the hips up to help you get more power out of it. But for the catpass, you're putting your hips high, and your catpassing and putting your hips even higher. You know.

18-interviewer
You mentioned the dip, is that like a dip before the obstacle, like, as a counter movement jump?

18-participant
Yeah a, a slight dip, I feel like this is again, one of those things that is most beneficial for for the slow to medium speed entries. And it's, I mean, the theory, at least behind it that seemed to make sense for me and why I kept up with it is that it allows me a little bit more range of motion, you know, versus having to just push up the obstacle from, you know, here or here, I'm able to actually do, you know, up above and get my hands on the obstacle for a longer time, thus potentially generating more power into it.

18-interviewer
So it gives you more range of motion with the upper body, with the arms.

18-participant
And with the jumping leg, as well. I find that there's another thing like to take like a like an ancillary movement, at least entry wise like the webster. That's one that I see people struggle with a lot of times because they're so upright in the movement the whole time, and then they just, you know, are flying down. And I think you can see that a little bit with a catpass, too, if people are, you know how sometimes they'll anticipate the obstacle, and now, they'll have the brakes kind of on. So since the brakes are on their chest is a little bit down in back. And so then they're throwing their weight down into the obstacle, rather than just kind of skipping it off like a stone. And I think the dip can help people naturally do that.

18-interviewer
I mean, I guess it's like any other, jumping in a way, you come down to go up?

18-participant
Exactly, yes.

18-interviewer
Naturally, almost.

18-participant
Yeah. Makes sense. That's a good way to say it.

18-interviewer
And right at the start, as well, I made a note that you also mentioned the hips coming up, which is something that's come up in quite a few other discussions I've had, do they have to, is that like, an important component, the hips getting up quite high?

18-participant
Yeah, I think so many, it depends, again, on the type of move, if you're doing something like a double Kong, double catpass, like your hips are going super high, but but you want to get them high enough that you are able to, I think, use your arms and get that clearance and get back to the you know, get back to landing on your feet, but it's on top of the obstacle or, or over it. So I generally, you know, want people to at least think about getting their hips, level with their head when they're, you know, doing the movement itself. And I think that also helps accentuate that lift that someone might need to, to get that feeling of weight on the arms is I think one of the biggest pieces of it, because if you're if you, you know, you've seen probably people do the like, they can clear the obstacle, and they kind of, like, touch it, right, and they and they stay very vertical that whole time. And people can do that 100%, but you can see that the, the arms aren't aiding them really in the movement that much. And in my perspective, you know, the clearance is way less, therefore, it's a more risky manoeuvre to keep your body vertical, rather than get it, you know, more inverted. So for me, I think the big benefits are more clearance for the legs, it helps give that, I kind of, think of it like a hammer, like, you know, our hips are generally where the centre of gravity is. So when you, if you throw a hammer up, it kind of spins in a weird metre, you know, it doesn't circle, it doesn't spin around smoothly. So by lifting those hips up, and then at the very end of that lift, being able to push, you know, jump, push and tuck, it can get you even higher. And it lets you put the weight on your arms, so you have the ability to push. Because I think for me, technically, when I'm doing like, any kind of parkour movement, I'm trying to ask myself, how much, how much power can I generate from every part of my body, you know, you know, even for something like a jump, the, you know, the arm swing itself can add, you know, a foot of distance to your jump, if not more than I think if you are you really want to get the most out of your arms for the catpass for a safety standpoint?

18-interviewer
Does bringing the hips up mean that you need to reorientate yourself for a landing in that case?

18-participant
Yeah, I think that's part of what that that last block in that push does is it helps, right you and angle the, you know, angle your chest or your spine in the direction that it needs to be, you know, if you're wanting to continue, if this is your head, you know, maybe you're only going to this, you know, but if you're going for like a catpass precision, you're rotating all the way maybe, you know, to a slightly less slightly past vertical with a backwards lean so that you can get that stick, you know, but that's, I think the arms help you control that, that orientation, that reorientation into the landing a lot.

18-interviewer
Do you find that people find that kind of you know, getting the hips high and trusting the arms a bit, something a bit intimidating about the movement or or something scary?

18-participant
Yeah, 100% and and that's why I think you start on the ground. Once they get comfortable in the ground. One of my favourite, like go to kind of obstacles if I'm teaching outside is like a picnic table lengthwise, so that if they do, you know, mess up, they just fall on the ground essentially, you know, at ground level because there's no distance so I think it's 100% an intimidating movement for for some newcomers. Obviously, we've probably all gotten like the, the young bloods that don't really care, this kind of huck it. But, you know, for most normal people kind of getting into it, I think that's sketchy, the only thing they might have done close to it would maybe be like a burpee, you know, if they've, if they, if they're athletic, but even then, you know, it's, I think there's a reason why it's just more risky, right, there's more momentum to do it, therefore, there's more risk associated with it. And then, to get that technique, it just takes some time. And there's that coordination, it's like, same thing, like, if you're trying to do a, you know, a power clean or something like that, you have to, there's a lot of little pieces that you got to get right to, to get that bar up off the ground where it gets your body up on top of that obstacle and feel like, you're not going to shin yourself or knee capitate or you know land on your head. And so I think the ground based stuff, you know, some hand, a lot of handstand side work, if they're not used to that, you know, just getting their body inverted on them with their weight on their arms, so they can learn that they can trust their arms, you know, so that they can get that more horizontal body position, which will then you know, inevitably be safer. It's, you know, we have these habits, you know, we're always upright, things are like this, and we're moving fast, it's probably not a good thing, usually, or, you know, same thing for like backflip, if you're going like this, and you're in the air usually something really bad's happening [laugh] People freak out. Like, well, I don't think it's as hard for people to get the hang of as the backflip mentally, I think it's still 100% of barrier for for some.

18-interviewer
I'm curious, because I made a note of this to follow up on. If it's kind of I mean, you know, I don't want to say risky, but it's a riskier vault to learn and stuff. But earlier on, you referred to it as a basic vault.

18-participant
Yeah.

18-interviewer
Is it, is it something you'd get people to learn pretty early on in their parkour training? Or is it a more advanced movement?

18-participant
I think if they're, if they don't have any, like red flags, mobility, or strength wise or injury wise, working on it at the ground level, or, you know, on a small ledge, let's say, knee high to hip high, long obstacle that they are not actually having to clear. It 100% can be something that I start with them on, on day one, you know what I mean? Because if I want, if and when I want them to get to the actual movement, I will already want them to have some familiarity with the, with the concept of it.

18-interviewer
Do you view it like, an integral vault for people to learn? Is it something that's-

18-participant
Uh, I mean, parkour in and of itself is not really like a integral thing, right? So, like, I don't need to do this anymore for anything, it's just fun, right? So I do... for me, the things that I like to teach people are first the things that I think will make them uncomfortable. And then second, the things that they enjoy, and then I guess, let's say those are second and third, actually and the first would be like, the things that I feel they, they might need as a baseline, you know what I mean? So this would be just like, if they can't squat with the, you know, flat feet or, or if they don't know how to jump or even if they're walking or running, and they're, you know, their knees are tracking in a funky way or their weights, you know, weird on that landing and stuff like that. So I feel like, basic kind of biomechanics is like the first thing that maybe they need, or maybe they naturally do, and then second it it would be, I feel like, you know, by giving them something new, something uncomfortable that, you know, that's not, that's outside of their comfort zone, you know, it doesn't have to be crazy. That's how one of the ways you get better, you know, as a human is just by not, not avoiding what makes you uncomfortable, whether that's conflict, whether that's, you know, the fear of injury or whatever, like that and understand that you you have more control than you think, so as far as like the catpass as a vault? I like it so 100% I like to teach it, you know what I mean? And I do think it has aspects that are unique to it as far as in comparison to other vaults. But um, you know, at the basic level, I would just want somebody to be able to maybe be able to do like a squat on, you know, with the knees on the outside of the feet on top of an obstacle. If that's like, literally as far as they were fussed to get, I wouldn't be that stressed about it, you know, it's they're movement in their body. And I would maybe I would love for them to be able to do like a catpass on top, with the knees inside, but you know, everybody's goals in their life and in their body and for parkour are gonna be different. So if someone's like, that they just don't like the move, but I can see that they're capable of it. And they've showed that they're, like, you know, able to do it, or at least understand it, then it's like, okay, well, then what do you want to work on?

18-interviewer
It's been really interesting, because I've, I've asked that question, and I've tried phrasing it a couple different ways. And almost invariably, the answer I've had back is very similar to yours. You know, it's, what what does the person want to get out of parkour, essentially, you know, and you can customise it to yourself. It's interesting for me, kind of part of this research that is, you know, is it I guess a better way to phrase it might be, is it just a really useful vault for people to learn? Is it a good one to have in your toolbox if you can?

18-participant
As far as it being very useful, if I was thinking like old school, I'm trying to survive type stuff, you know what I mean, like, I feel like you can do most of what you want with like step vaults, you know, you can do a really big jumping step vault, you can get some exit distance from it, it gives you a little bit more control, if you don't know what's happening after. So I feel like you know, the, the only thing that maybe the, the catpass can do is get you further, you know what I mean? If the jump, if the step up is too high, you know, you can also just jump up onto something and jump again, right. So I think it can get you further and, you know, it gives you a little bit of a power boost. I know, if I've been playing like tag like games, I can 100%, you know, run and hit like a catpass and go for like this dive to tag somebody, which might be useful, but I feel like it's, you know, it's dependent on the goal. Like if it's a young person, if they're interested in, you know, maybe one day being competitive, or even just seeing like, what their bodies can do. I think the catpass is a great movement. But if I was, you know, teaching a 50 year old lady, or an old dude that, you know, has had a bunch of injuries, I'm not that fussed with, with her. So I think for me, it's more about like, the stage of life that they're at, you know, if they're, you know, if they're relatively healthy, I think it's a cool movement to learn. And it can add a lot to, I think it gives, it gives a good feeling and stuff like this, but if they're just trying to move better, I don't think it's that important. But if they're trying to move like their fastest, or their most powerfully then yeah, for sure.

18-interviewer
The, the thing that it makes me really curious about is, you know, the contrast of this idea of like a very wide open, personalised parkour, and the idea of coaching, where you kind of have to have kind of ideas of what you want to pass along and what you want to teach. And we have these named movements. And it's not like there's a curriculum, or it's like a martial art, where you learn these forms in this order or anything like that. Just contrasting those two, I find really interesting. So is trying to figure out with people, you know, we have these movements. But whenever I ask people about them, they're always like, yeah you can do, you can pick and choose, you can do whatever. So it's like, I mean, you've given very good answers. I just, I've noticed that kind of contrast come up. And I'm really curious how people view that.

18-participant
Yeah, I mean, if anything, I think it's, it's kind of like the juxtaposition between if you want to take the martial arts for an example, if you you have the form training and you have, you know, the technique training and stuff like that, and then you have sparring, you know what I mean, and so, for example, for my, I haven't done martial arts a long time, like formally or whatever, but for my last belt test, for example, I had to demonstrate like 48 different throws, you know what I mean? But when I'm sparring, or grappling, I use like two or three, you know, those are like my bread and butter and, and rather than, I kind of think of it like there's this horizontal progression, and there's a vertical progression. For me, as an athlete, and as a trainer, my preference is for someone to take a technique and get close to mastery with that, if that makes sense, rather than pile on a bunch of things that they can kind of do if the situation's right. And I think that's, you know, more useful, that's my application for, like I said, just what I explained for martial arts stuff. And I think it applies a lot in parkour, especially if you're doing like improvisation, you know, type games, you know, like tag or? Or, or if you make a mistake during a planned, you know, speed course, or, or if you're just trying to go, you know what I mean, you'll see like, okay, well, I can, I'm comfortable with these vaults, but that's pretty much it, you know, I'm comfortable with these moves. And that's pretty much it. And so I think it's this kind of thing, where there's, there's so much that you can give somebody technique wise with parkour, and there is definitely like a foundational thing, I think, and for me, the basis of the foundations is kind of like that I that I conceptualise is like, what body positions are you put into and what different things are happening. You know, for example, like a similarity, if you take like the the powerful underbar that people do, you know, that's, that's a movement that's similar to what you would do if you were trying to glide Kip. Which is like the gymnastics way to get up on a bar, you know, that's like their muscle up, or it also shares, you know, the hip extension qualities that happen with a deadlift, or that power clean, it also shares that similarities with a Kip up. So like this movement, archetype, I guess, if you will, you know, has has its uses. And so something like a catpass has a has a benefit, that you're not going to get from a step vault, just from a neurological point of view as far as the mind body connection. And hence slightly for me, that's the, that's the where it kind of falls away, right is like, slightly less, if you're just thinking from a purely technical standpoint, you know, because you'll see people dash pre things that people can catpass pre, you know what I mean, you'll see people step vault pre stuff like that, you'll see people do giant, you know, you can probably do a way bigger stride step, you know, when you're jumping straight into step vaults, then you can do a dive Kong, even if you can't, it's at least way safer for your body. Because you're getting to absorb with your leg rather than have to take it all in your wrists. You know what I mean? So if we're thinking just purely from that point of view, for me, the benefits of the catpass are way more mental, I guess. And, and, like I said, just a different move for your CNS than then what it can do for you in the world. You know what I mean? That's, I think, where things get way more subjective, based on body type and desires and goals. So yeah.

18-interviewer
So that that kind of movement pattern that dive onto the hands and then, you know, push and pull through. It's just kind of like a foundational pattern that is just useful?

18-participant
Yeah, I think so. Because it lets you get, um... it's, it lets you understand how to jump off your hands. You know, for whatever reason, if you need to, you know what I mean. And I think that, that will be useful for some people. I mean, the way I heard the story was like, Stephane Vigroux, was training with David Belle, and he couldn't jump over the same things that David Belle could jump over. And so he was using his hands to help him so 100% for Stephane, who, I guess, was like, the first one that did it in that in that community, it was useful for him, right? You know, and it allowed him to accomplish the same task, you know, get from here to here that his training partner was accomplishing and in his own way, so I think there's that benefit of it, it's, you know, options are never a bad thing, right. And then secondarily, there's, you know, how it benefits you, you think about if, if I not that I would ever do this, but if I said, Okay, I'm going to train one person only with jumps and one person only with catpasses, I would guess that that person would at least have a little bit more balanced muscular development than the person that is only working jumps. And so for me, that's the other aspect is like, I want people to at least at the basic level, you know, have the capacity to push in front of them, to push overhead, to push underneath them, like for dip or whatever. Same for pulling and then, same thing for their jumps and stuff like that, they should be able to jump well off either leg, off both legs, in different kinds of positions and stuff like this. It's that same idea of not really trying to worry about piling on a tonne of techniques, I want them to see these basic techniques and understand that that's actually where the all the fancy ones come from, you know what I mean? They're just combinations of foundations. Or if you take like a palm flip that, for example, it's just a backflip and a catpass put together on a wall. You know what I mean? Catpass is a foundational parkour movement, just because of its differences from the other vaults. And then, you know, backflip is not necessarily foundational parkour movement, but it's a it's a basic, if somebody's trying to do acrobatics, you know.

18-interviewer
So these kind of foundational things, you know, particularly for coaching, maybe they've kind of become this collection of things that gets passed on, because they've kind of stood the test of time a little bit. They've just proven their utility? And whether individuals adopt them or like them, or what is kind of down for them. But it's just like, I mean, maybe I think you mentioned earlier, the pareto thing, maybe it's just like their their a common collection that works for a lot of people for a lot of ways. But obviously, people are always going to have their own preferences and individuality.

18-participant
Yeah exactly. No 100%. I mean, it's just like, I mean, it's like anything, right? If you're, if you want to be successful, that's such a vague thing. But there's so many ways you can do that, you know, people go to college and become doctors, some people, you know, they, they work with their hands and do this kind of stuff. You know, it's the same thing. Like, with parkour, it's exactly that, you're trying to just move from in move around in your space. And, as you said, there's these people that came before us. And they've blazed these different pathways. And it's our choice which paths we want to take and how we want to branch off from that. I think I saw that I saw a quote from Seneca recently that ties exactly into this. I wish I remember the exact quote, otherwise, but but his his plan, his idea was with stoicism, for example, you know, to take to take heed and learn from the people in our past. But that doesn't mean you need to follow the path they followed, you know, stringently. And, you know, the Bruce Lee, when I know well enough, you know, it's like, you know, take what's useful, and then discard what's useless, and it seems, you know, for you, right, there's not like, the whole thing, when one person that I just came to mind when you were mentioning, this is someone like, [name] on, I don't know where he's from, and I'm sure I butchered his name, but he is like, a disabled parkour guy. And he's a freaking beast, he's like, so good, but he moves obviously, way different, in some ways than the rest of us, because he can't literally run into things, you know what I mean, he, he does connected plyos to get into stuff, but you know, he does lots of dashes. Because that just facilitates his body movement better, but he can still, you know, catpass, he does side flips, he does backflips, all these kinds of things. And, you know, his technique is definitely going to be different than ours. And what's useful for him is not necessarily going to be useful for us, right. So, I think those those pathways is, is one of the things that makes parkour the potential to be as accessible as it is, because, you know, yeah, we have, like, all these different things you can do, but what you have to do, you know, it might change as competitions get bigger, and you know, I assume, then then that might shift of what is valued, because then the value is going to shift of just the thing to do for fun, or fitness or, you know, whatever, into sport, you know, and that's where things are going to shift. If you think of like gymnastics, from the 70s to today, they didn't do nearly as many giants, for example, where they're just spinning all the way around the bar, you know, in an extended body position. They did way more like hip circley type things and small compressed type things if we're thinking about uneven bars, you know, and, and so in the 70s, those movements were way more valuable. The uneven bars were closer, you could do different transitions. Nowadays, the uneven bars are almost far enough apart, that the people can be fully extended, you know, because that's where the sport went. So now, what is a foundational technique in the 70s could differ, you know, from what it is today in gymnastics just because of the apparatus that's changed. You know what I mean? And so the cool thing I love about Parkour is it's not technically any apparatus, but that's probably going to change, you know, as things start to progress down into this competitive route, which is, you know, it's not a bad or a good thing, it's just the thing. And so the thing that we would hope is that as wide as I perceive parkour, at least to be, that whatever snapshot, you know, a competition is of that, you know, it would hopefully get a clear enough picture that somebody can at least get an idea of, of parkour of what it can be, you know, what I mean? When you think of, you know, only seeing speed competitions, you're never gonna know, like, all the super dope stuff people can do, you know, with flips in, and all that kind of stuff. And the same thing, if you just some people, you know, bouncing around from wall to wall doing, like, the craziest tricks, you're not going to necessarily get the idea of seeing, you know, people do super, you know, long endurance lines, or the crazy descent type stuff that's happening. And so, you know, I think parkour in and of itself is such a wide discipline, that there's inevitably going to be these different competitive offshoots that already exist, right. It's only getting further that but but as a coach, at least as a coach that I want to be, I would like to, I would like people to give to give people the picture, and then they go down the path that they want to go, you know, give them the foundation and let them build whatever house they want to build on top of that foundation. I know  that was like, not a catpass related [laugh]

18-interviewer
It's all good. Just, it's great. Just to switch track slightly. How did you yourself, learn the catpass movement? Were you self taught? Or did you go to classes or watch YouTube videos?

18-participant
Yeah, so I started before YouTube existed. And I was the first person in my city, in Texas that started training, like 18 years ago, or something like this, all I got to see was, you know, speed air man, and like, frickin, what is it the BBC advert and some things, you know, Yamakasi type things. And so, I taught it in a way that I mean, I did it in a way that I wouldn't teach us, but just, you know, it's like a young 13 year old kid, I was like, okay, so they're just diving headfirst, and they're pushing on the bottom, you know, the thing or whatever. So, went to a picnic table, and then just ran at it and jumped headfirst and pushed on it, and thankfully, it worked. So, you know, for that I'm grateful for but I didn't, you know, my technique 100% changed too you know, as as, as I developed it too, you know, like, I did it there. And then, you know, I definitely was like a bit of a... you know, when you do anything and you start to begin it, you can get like kind of an ego about it. Right? You know, I'm the only one training parkour, I got these, like, cool moves and stuff like that. And then I remember, I like just humbled myself, so bad once trying to do like a, you know, catpass over like a bar neck high standing with like a two metre drop. For some reason I'm like, yeah, I got this, but I'm not, at this point I'm still super early in my training. I'm not strong at all, I was like a video game kid before this. You know what I mean? So I like full on, I don't even get up, I just hit my ankles, and then I just go headfirst. And it had like, a huge fear barrier for me for years after that, like, scraped my face up and sprained my neck and my wrist and I was super embarrassed because it was like at the end of school, so everybody's heading to their buses, and they just watched me eat it super hard [laugh] But it was, it was a good thing, right? At least I was able to turn it into a good thing. But because of that, you know, I had a huge fear barrier that I then had to overcome for myself, it took me literally, like a year or a year and a half to be able to even do or commit to a catpass again, you know what I mean? And so this is I've had this, these kinds of lessons with things like the catpass, with the back tuck, where it's like, you know, the, the mental barrier is often the hardest one for somebody to overcome. And the best way to help somebody overcome this is to is to gradually introduce, you know, right, the risk or the fear or whatever it is and to just to gently touch on it until, you know, that barriers has eroded enough that it's surmountable. And and so, you know, I got really good at finding ways to, to work into stuff that I was afraid of and finding progressions, I guess I should say. That compounded with like, my first student was like a 57 year old woman who, she had no ACL, she previously broken her spine, and for some reason, she wanted to train parkour. So, you know, I was another instance where I was like, Okay, well, I think this was like, it was like, literally my first paying person for teaching. And I was like, Okay, I need to, like, I need to do this right. You know, and, and so from my own personal experience, I tried to, you know, even the young whippersnappers that are like, ready to just dive at all, at a picnic table and push off it, I think it's better to, you know, doesn't have to be as slow as I would with, you know, someone like, my first student or whatever, but to ramp up into it, you know, in a nice, nice, smooth way, gentle way, progressive way.

18-interviewer
And is that kind of understanding, and you mentioned your technique updating over time as well. Is that just from your own experience? Or has that come from talking to other people? Or any, you know, I, I've seen that you've got some coaching qualifications and stuff, anything come from any of those? Or is it all just experience and down to you?

18-participant
I mean, I think the most valuable thing for my training was to go and travel and train with other peers, people have, like a similar, you know, experience level or whatever, because they, they had to solve similar problems in their own way. Which, which, then when, you know, we share ideas from there. I think it can, it can really help boost, you know, their training. And then also, I think a lot from videos, obviously, like, that's all I had in the beginning. And so, you know, I did talk with one guy, I remember, when I first started training, his name is [name], and he's kind of a jerk on the dot net forums back in the day, but for whatever reason, I decided , I got to reach out to him to help get advice. I know, he did advice for muscle ups and stuff like this, I can't remember if he gave any advice, specifically for the catpass. But I think yeah, just having an open mind and sharing and always knowing, like, even just, it was only, I guess, four years ago, or something that I had that little epiphany that was given to me from my friend, Pedro, for how I wasn't pushing that much with my cat passes. And so he was hitting this rail catpass, pretty, super easily. And I was like, struggling, and then he just, you know, gave one little tip, and I start inputting into it, and I got it, you know, quite easily. And so, you know, even just that expanded my, my, you know, technical idea of a catpass, or how to how to do it. So I think it's, you know, I think videos can help, people can help and, you know, people maybe outside of your circle was, like, at least for me, what was the most most valuable thing, right, because, you know, if you're training with a community, well, the community will start to naturally kind of, like, coalesce, you know, and there'll be a similar style or a similar thinking that happens in there, obviously, you know, outliers of that, but it's still, you know, there's a reason why people will go the Russian style or the British style, right? Because, because people were training together, and they're sharing those ideas, most of the ideas that get connected, so I think it's, it's super good, travelling, learn and share like that.

18-interviewer
Like a social exchange kind of, of ideas.

18-participant
Definitely. Like, you know, like, open source, like an open source programme, like, has the potential to be super, super useful and super helpful for the community at large. And I think, you know, Parkour is kind of like, open source movement. You know, it started in a viral way. It didn't have, you know, like, a lineage like some martials arts do, where, you know, the style of martial art that you're practising is quite similar, most likely to the one that, you know, just like a language, right, that has new aspects of it, but but it's still that language. And I think parkour wasn't like this at all really. So, the way people train parkour, at least in my travelling in the US and the Middle East, you really, really see the things those communities valued, then you can utilise that and share the stuff that your community valued to, to, as a worldwide community, be stronger, you know, the more knowledgeable. I mean, that's exactly what this is right?

18-interviewer
I really like that description of it as open source, I think that's a really nice way to describe it. And when you were kind of doing these exchanges, do you find that people have the fundamental idea of the catpass movement? You know, trying to focus on the catpass, but really for any movement, I guess, that's kind of remained similar? And it's, it's the, the kind of smaller parts, or the tweaks and the minor adjustments, that that change for groups? Or is it, have you found that it's like a radically different movement in some other communities?

18-participant
No, I think it's quite, it's quite similar, but it's just the only real discrepancies maybe I've seen is like, how picky people are on like, how linearly your knees are going, you know, if you're a little bit to the side, or, you know, because you can, if you're pushing early enough, you can get your legs to the side and still kind of have a little bit of power, you know, when it's not, it's not like a side vault where that one arm is staying on the whole way, you know, you can kind of push and then the legs... And then there's people that, you know, will do that maybe a lot and still call it a Kong or catpass, or whatever. So, but from like, the fundamental idea of, you're running or jogging, or whatever, projecting yourself and popping off and getting a bit of lift with both hands, as you tuck, you know, even if your tuck is a little bit, you know, sideways or whatever. It's still, is like a catpass. You know what I mean? It's like, it's like, British English and English, right? They're still saying, I don't know, like I said, the examples. But.

18-interviewer
Whether you're using an S or a Z in all your words, that kind of difference.

18-participant
Aluminium's, aluminium, even if it's aluminium, it's the same thing.

18-interviewer
And how about when it comes to like coaching techniques for the movement? Are they similar, people have like a basic idea that has kind of spread, and it's just kind of individual tweaks and stuff or do people have, again, different approaches completely?

18-participant
I think, funnily enough, I've seen coaching as maybe where somebody or some people get more stringent or less, more or less flexible in what they perceive as their method, you know, is the best method for it. I couldn't say why. And I didn't think about that until just now. But I've definitely seen people be way more picky with how to teach a catpass than what is a catpass, which is a funny distinction. I never thought about that before. But yeah, so in that respect, I think I, you know, I see lots of different methods of what is the best way to prepare somebody for it. And my perspective is the best way is the way that the student gets the quickest, right. So I'm sure I saw different methods, probably each of the certifications that I took, I couldn't, you know, say it exactly. Because they all kind of blend together. But for me, the benefit is in not, you know, not just taking one tool, you know, and using it for everything is trying to have as many different tools as I can for the job, you know.

18-interviewer
I'm curious about the certifications, as you mentioned them, because I have some experience with some of these, but not not all of the ones that you do. Is it... Do they teach how to teach specific movements? Or is it more general coaching techniques? Have you ever actually been taught?, like, this is how you teach a catpass? Or is it more just that it's assumed from you being an experienced parkour practitioner, you know how to do it, and there's more general coaching skills being taught.

18-participant
I think from observing, the more or the less experienced students, there's, they definitely what's it called, give a little bit more progressions and attention for the technical stuff, depending on the group because I, I, like I said, I did my certifications, for thinking for ADAPT, for example, but I sat in on a couple of different ADAPT ones where I wasn't teaching, I was just observing and helping out, I was in town or whatever. And then you would see, okay, maybe they needed more help. So they would give a quick tip, but for me, I think the biggest focus was, I mean, it's different for each one, for the ADAPT one, I would say, at least the level one was like making sure that you can at least do some of the basic movements and know some basic coaching stuff. I can't recall there being specific, you know, because there's, there's a lot of material to cover, right and, and they do it just a weekend, most of, all these certs were like that. And the Parkour EDU one, for example, the they did, they were mostly focused on the teaching, which I liked, they weren't that fussed as ADAPT is on like, you know, making you do a bunch of stuff, which is cool. I enjoyed that. But I understand, you know, that's not directly applicable necessarily to coaching as the actual activity. I understand trying to keep the spirit or whatever. But, for example, in the Parkour EDU, that I took the coaches, they, they were kind of known for their things like one was known for climb ups, and the other was known for their rolls and falls. So the other than kind of the general vaults and movements type stuff and some coaching stuff, those techniques we did specifically focus on for our own progression and for helping others progress. And then, the APK one was so long ago that it's a bit hard for me to remember, but I think I had a similar impression. But I also felt that was a bit that was a bit just more of a debate, because there was the same idea, like I was mentioning, where like, Okay, this is how you should teach this movement. And someone's like, no, this is how you should teach this, right? Just devolved into kind of like a bit of a pissing contest, you know what I mean, at certain points. So I think, it's there. I mean, for example, I was gonna, if I can, I was gonna screen share with you, I have a website that I'm working on. And we have like a catpass page, for example.

18-interviewer
I actually had a look at it after you filled in the form. Not in great detail yet. But I did check it out as ah I need to, I need to look around. I mean, it's so it's kind of my next question is, you know, should that stuff be in coaching certifications? Or do you think it should be down to people learning just from experience, how to teach movement? I know it's quite a loaded question [laugh]

18-participant
No, I mean, as far as coaching certifications go, I, I understand them as like, as a necessary evil, you know, if you want to say that. And one thing that I think [name] said during one of the ADAPT certs that I was sitting in on was like, certification doesn't mean you're good, it just means you're not like, bad, you know, you're above a certain level of bad, but it's acceptable, or something, he probably said it better than that. But I mean, in my opinion, something like an apprenticeship is way more applicable to all you know, it's probably most things honestly, if you're going to be teaching it, you know, if you think of a teacher in school, how much schooling do they have to do for their subjects and stuff like that before they're teaching, you know what I mean? But you know, you can go to a frickin weekend parkour certification or a weekend CrossFit certification. And, and then you're teaching this stuff to people, and this is stuff that could conceivably debilitate them for the entirety of their lives, if they are trying to do a WoD, and they don't have the good technique, but you have 30 students, you know, doing that, or, you know, you go to teach a catpass. But you're used to you, you know, I've had this with some teachers that I've trained, where they, they were aware enough and acknowledged, like, I kind of forgot how I taught, you know, learned this thing for myself, because I've been doing it so long. I'm just, I just do it now. And, you know, they forget that struggle, right. And so, if you're not, you know, maybe if you are just training with yourself and peers, you, you get a little bit of a warped sense of what a human is capable of, you know what I mean? And so I think, I think it's important to give, to not force somebody to take a certain way, but to give people options and possibilities, right? If we think of like the the pareto principle thing again, it's like, what are the most likely things, bad things to happen for a catpass? You know what I mean? Like shinning, hitting your knee, you know, landing on your head, that's like the worst thing so what things can we do to mitigate that possibility while learning the catpass. Okay, lower the fall risk, doing it on the ground. Okay, still keep a low fall risk, but allow them to work on a more normal entry, you know, on a picnic tables or a long object, you know, okay, they can't comfortably pop on like catpass on top of the obstacles to get to their feet. So they don't have that as a bailing mechanism, you know what I mean? And the secondary thing that doing that catpass on top helps with this, it helps them get their chest up, which can give a little bit more flexibility, if they did clip their knee, or their shin, you know what I mean? Like, these days, if I clip my knee, I'm not usually landing on my head, you know what I mean? I'm, I'll clip that knee, and I can make that knee light enough that you know, like it hits and then I am able still to get my chest up and get my other leg to the ground. Right. So it's like, I think it's more like these are the important things is like how to just mitigate risk in the technique that you're doing. And then how you do that is like up to you, you know, any of the people that I've taught as students, for parkour, or teachers for parkour, it's like, I have these ideas or whatever that I've developed, and I'm happy to get their, you know, input as well. But the goal, first and foremost is for them to be safe. And then second is to like, the way that works is the way that works, right? I said, I don't want anybody to be like a Jeremy parkour robot, or, you know, Jeremy, parkour robot teacher or whatever, because they're not going to understand intrinsically how to get that message across. And I think the authenticity is invaluable when it comes to, to, you know, learning something, or passing on something, or, or really enjoying something, you know, when you're doing it, when you when you can learn to do it for that intrinsic feeling of you just enjoy it. I think that has that benefit, right. And so I think, especially for something like, back to the catpass, as it being a potentially risky move compared to some other moves, though, that being said, you know, people wreck themselves bad on step vaults, you know what I mean? So it's like, who knows, you know, you can't, with 100% certainty, say, any move is more dangerous than the other, but this one has more potential for danger. Therefore, it's important, I think, to find ways to, to mitigate that risk, first and foremost, and then give as many different options, you know, as you can, for example, that like, squat on movement, where you know, your hands are together and your feet on the outside, I don't use that movement that much to teach people to catpass. But I know the Yamak, used it a lot when we were, I was doing some classes with them. And I have found it useful for for students that just have trouble getting those knees up, you know what I mean? And they are really uncomfortable to squat with their legs together, because they're at least working the hip flexors, to drive those knees up and get that push. And then one day, you know, that could conceivably aid them in the catpass. So it's like, I've done this progression for in my, in the last year and a half, I think two or three students, you know what I mean, but that doesn't mean it's not useful. It was super useful to them. Right. And I wouldn't have known that progression unless it was shown to me by another person, you know, and then I wouldn't have tried it for myself, you know, I wouldn't have known it was useful unless I kind of kept it and looked for what the student needed, right? Oh, man, they can't bring their knees up, or they can't keep their feet together the squat, you know, it's just really for uncomfortable them. Okay. Well, how do I get them to at least do a catpass-like thing, symmetrical push, knees tucking in, you know, this move? It's like, you know, it's like, you're building like an encyclopaedia, right. I mean, that's what makes a good coach is someone that has that experience, and, you know, has had hundreds of people as a guinea pig, in addition to hopefully themselves as a guinea pig and their other peers, as you know, it's this open source thing that we're trying to talk about, like, what's the, what's the solution? Right? After, after that, or before that it's just, is this safe? You know, is this the safest way? Are we making it, you know, as safe as it can be? And I'm talking about explicitly for beginners, obviously, you know, because I think the thing that I'd like to transfer into it, again, is like, if they're, if they're reliant on you as their coach, then they're not going to be able to think for themselves and understand like, Okay, this is too much for me, this is not too much for me. And so, in the beginning, they have no idea what the heck they can do. So it's your job to help them figure that out, and then, and then they can do whatever the heck they want with the catpass. You know, they can go for some sketchy shit. And you can say, okay, like, was that a good idea? You know, you're like, Okay, but now you you learn this or whatever and ideally, ideally, we're going to avoid that as much as possible. Right? You know, my, one of my other the guy that did the APK cert, actually, you know, he was he said he was the kind of person that you know, if somebody told you the burner was hot, he just had to see, you know. So, you know, there's the people that we were all probably a combination of it, you know, someone tells you the burner is hot, and you believe them, you're like, cool. And then someone tells you it's hot. You're like, ehh, okay, yeah. And, and with something like parkour, and some of the higher risk things, ideally, you want them to learn the first way. But we learn, you know, lessons. Sorry, I talked a lot there.

18-interviewer
No, it's great. I am, I'm kind of just a tiny bit aware the time as well, so I just... Is there... We've covered a lot of the points I'd like to get through, which is great. Is there anything about the movement that you're curious about for yourself, or that you wish, you would like to know more about? Just for yourself? And I always like to say to people as well, it's fine if the answer's no.

18-participant
I mean, I would just be interested... So I had a funny instance, just a couple months ago, where it was a brand new student, but he was like, super, just a really natural mover, and he got the catpass like, first try and super easy. And me and one of the other, just normal community guys were trying this large catpass to cat with a bit of a high take off, you know, and I was like doing my dip and running and all this kind of stuff and having a little bit of trouble to get to it, you know. And this kid goes for it. And he gets super close, just trying it, you know what I mean? And so then I understood at that moment that, at that speed is kind of what I was talking about the beginning that like my dip was actually hindering my technique, because it was creating a longer transfer time from my run into my catpass. You know, and so and then I, you know, took that lesson from this complete newbie, just by watching him. And I got it, you know that next try. And so I'm interested, I would really be interested in knowing a little bit more logically of like, how the technique changes through the different speeds, you know what I mean, if you look like someone like [name], like, he can frickin fly, you know what I mean? And I think it's in part with how comfortable he is with his acceleration into the catpass. And then that transference of it, and I think that's like, for me, that's my least practised part, you know, would be maximal effort running into catpass. And then, because it's high risk, and then secondarily would be, would probably be similar application, but to rails, you know, what I mean? Like seeing how, how the technique changes, as it's applied to rails, like, at what point you know, do do people always try and do this when they're going to a rail? Is there a certain point where they'll commit to this, because it's riskier, but maybe it can give them some more power. I've felt that a little bit on like, some fatter rails before, or some more odd shaped rails where it felt riskier to do it, but I felt like if I wanted to get that distance, I had to, you know, had to do it that way.

18-interviewer
So, I mean, with rails, is it because you can't get the hand flat? It kind of changes how you can do that push, we were talking about?

18-participant
Yeah, I think so. You know, it's like you, it's like you're trying to do a catpass but your fingers are cut off, right? You don't have the, that's the flexor and the whole follow through to, to help connect with everything. So I would love like some, you know, kind of like what you're doing but like with, with, I would I wish there was like a nice way to like biomechanically analyse, like what each person's, you know, doing at different speeds. And then, you know, be able to amalgamate that into some kind of approximation of like, how these people are transferring their movements, but to me, I think the best way to do that is like watching it and also talking with people, you know, I haven't, I haven't, for example, heard many people, not that I've talked to many, not as many as you for sure about the catpass, about, like, you know, when they dip, do they always dip, at what speed do they stop dipping, you know, what I mean? And I that was, you know, something that I realised in the past month that I was like, okay, sometimes I'm overly reliant on this dip, and it's hurting me. And I'd be really interested for for some more aware, you know, practitioners that you know, are also competent in something like the catpass to, to weigh in on, like, how the technique changes at their speed, and yeah, how the technique changes for them on rails or rails at speed things like this. I think that's, that's interesting for me, because it's like, it's something more towards the advanced and of what you can do, or what you're trying to do with a catpass. You know, and I think, you know, you go to YouTube, and there's a thousand beginner tutorials on catpass. And everybody can, you know, teach you the basics of one, but what is, you know, what's getting somebody from their plateau, you know, what I mean? Like plateau in a catpass, to then get that more, more power and distance.

18-interviewer
Is that... so is kind of distance something that is, like, that's what you kind of progress towards, with the kong, like increasing the distance off the back end of the vault?

18-participant
For me, I think so, I love, I like the exit distance feeling. I mean, I see, obviously, people do the entry distance too, which is cool. But for me, it's like hard on the wrist, I would rather double, you know, if I had that opportunity. But I think one of the things that the catpass does that feels unique to me is that feeling of like literally jumping off your hands and getting a tonne of power and being able to kind of fly out of it. So I think that's definitely one of the places it excels and I'm, it feels super cool, it's a lot of fun to do, so it's something that I definitely prioritise. And that's something that I think, is only possible once you start getting competent enough for the movement, you know, what I mean? Like, take the percentage of people, you know, I imagine if you did a statistics of who can do a catpass in the world, and then who can do a catpass level to precision seven feet or something like that, you know, what I mean? The numbers probably go way down from there. And then there's people like [name] are doing, like ten foot or something level precisions. And there's some other people that are doing that, too. And it's like, you know, what's, obviously I'm sure there's like a genetic element, but I'm sure there's also a technical element, you know, even myself, my, my maximum that I did, I think was two and a half metres level. And when I, it was just interesting, from my first attempt at it, it seemed impossible. After 45 minutes of attempts, I barely got it, you knot what I mean? And, and I wasn't present enough in that moment to understand as much what it was other than maybe just getting less reliant on this, what's it called this dip, and, and more, you know, comfortable just sprinting as hard as I could at, at the object, making sure I accelerate at the end, that kind of stuff. But I'm super interested in these kinds of things. Obviously, there's no market for it, necessarily. But, you know, how are people you know, getting, you know, how are people progressing into these level lache pres into these big, you know, catpasses in these catpass rails into the, you know, these kind of more advanced parkour movements, you see, you know, even people, at least I think the progressions on stuff like side flips precision, you know, even that's becoming like a basic move, for example, but I'm interested in seeing the methods of like, you know, elite parkour people, for some of these, you know, these foundational moves that they're pushing way further than other people. But I think it's a super niche thing, right? Who's gonna [unclear]

18-interviewer
Hopefully me in a couple years, who knows? Okay. Is there anything else that kind of popped into your head or you've thought of at any point that we didn't get to, or anything else you'd like to add?

18-participant
Could I show you the catpass page real quick that I have on explore parkour?

18-interviewer
Yeah. Is that, is there something in there that is, you want to include in the study, or is it-

18-participant
It's more just a method thing, I guess, if I look at it real quick. It's like, you still hear me, right?

18-interviewer
Yeah, the only thing I'm thinking is if I transcribe this, I'm not able to transcribe the images. That's all. But I'm happy to talk about it.

18-participant
I can just talk about it a bit.

18-interviewer
Sure.

18-participant
One of the things that we're trying to do with it is, is kind of similar to, what's it called , this is what I is talking about giving different paths right. So, in it, we we show the movement itself, we also break up the movement into the common problems that can happen, generally what we, me and my friend have seen of the common problems would happen usually in the takeoff, or in the middle portion of the of the movement. And so-

18-interviewer
I'm sorry to interrupt, but it hasn't come up my screen. I don't know if your screen shared yet.

18-participant
I don't think I did it right. Let's try that again. Can you give me permission to share? I think that's what it is.

18-interviewer
Ah. Ah, yep, there we go. Should be able to now.

18-participant
Perfect. Okay, can you see what's happening? Okay, so, here we have like, the different movement, pieces of it, for example, just the different angles that you can, you know, see the catpass happening, it gets a little bit slow, but you kind of get the idea, landing shot, hand shot, and then we have even sequencing for it. So it kind of talks through the, the basic kind of sequence of the movement, as you're going through, we have, we break up these problems again. So you know, people maybe have problems in the takeoff, this one taking off too close, you know, we explained why this might happen, then we have problems in the middle, why you might have some issues with that movement, and you can use a little side by side analysis type deal, to look at it, obviously it's not finished yet. But then from there, you know, we go into different progressions that you can be used in there. And they're, they're just kind of there, there'll be little explanations of, you know, what it can help with at the bottom of it, or whatever, you know, it's just the gifs, but you can see different things that, you know, might help you with the movement. See if this one works as well. Yeah. And so you see, that's helping with that snap down, and what you would do for like, the, you know, Kong Precision, and this is like, harder, probably, then, you know, when you're trying to actually do the catpass. So, some of these things are more like to give you a surplus of ability for when you're trying to do that movement, right. And then after progressions, the last kind of thing that last two things that we have are the what we call a modifier, so it's ways that you can alter the movement to, you know, to play with it. So this is a combination, you're mixing the catpass with the landing of a jump, you know, what I mean? You're doing it on, you know, a bar, how that changes the technique, just like how we explained or, if you're trying to do it on, you know, trying to get that exit distance instead of the, what's it called the entry distance. Another modifier that we would potentially put here would be like that palm flip that I was talking about, since you're doing that to kong. And then from there, this one I don't think is organised yet. But then the last thing would be like different movements that, you know, help you with it. So in like the tuck up, which is, you know, you driving both your knees in, and then the push up and variations of that. So that kind of goal is to break it down for students in this kind of way, if that makes sense.

18-interviewer
Yeah. I really like that. And I like the kind of grouping of things as, you know, common problems and stuff, rather than perhaps focusing on like, this is the way you should do the movement. It's like, these are the various things that we've noticed people commonly have issues with.

18-participant
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's, that's 100%. Because we're, you know, especially if this is aiming to be like, we're kind of trying to be like an online parkour encyclopaedia. It's like, the resource I wish I had, you know. And, and, and so we have to kind of go through from when I was teaching, and from, you know, our own experience, what things can help, and you can see, you know, even then, it's not in this one exactly. But we have like in our cat crawl one. It talks about, like, a common problem is to, you know, when you're doing the cat crawl, to not move contralaterally, but to move, you know, both hands at the same time. And then we, you know, express in it that, yeah, this is a common problem for the catpass. But this also is a move in and of itself. You know what I mean? And as long as it's not hurting you, this thing is, had something valuable too, and the point is that you're choosing to do the move instead of letting your habit make you do the ipsilateral movement versus the contralateral if we take the cat crawl for example.

18-interviewer
It's kind of one of the things I'm curious about with this study is, you know, you have something like that where you have these modifiers, for example, you mentioned you have things like the different takeoffs, the different landings, dive kong, double Kong, stuff like that. But they're all still kind of within that catpass family, is that where it comes down to that kind of fundamental pattern of movement, you're talking about like that, hands, hands, jumping off the obstacle, almost like diving onto that. That's the kind of core it?

18-participant
Yeah no, I think so. Because, I mean, eventually, I would love to, like, so I made this website with zero, well I'm using [unclear] or whatever. So it's not like having to do hard coding or anything like that, anyway, but zero kind of web design experience and stuff. And one of the main things I'm, other things I want to try and help show is these kind of like, familial connections, coordination wise with these different movements. So like, you know, you were saying this catpass archetype, how it fits into dive catpasses, or exit distance and how the technique changes, or the palm flip or the pop on top and being ready to plyo after or, let's see another one, or, you know, the one on the ground, because that's a different move in and of itself too. And, and so, seeing these, or the burpee, which is like, like, I would say, is the exercise version that's closest to like a catpass, you know, what I mean, or the top out for a climb up, you know, all these things, they share this kind of cat pass archetype. And then from that there's like these related moves, you know, if we take the, if we take the, the catpass precision, it's just the entry of, the entry of a catpass, the middle of a catpass, and then kind of the middle slash end of a precision jump and the end of a precision jump. So my theory is that by helping someone get really comfortable with so, if there's five parts to catpass precision, you know, if you can help them, if they can learn two of those parts, by learning the catpass, and the other two of those parts by learning the precision, then they'll only technically have one completely new thing to do, neurologically, to understand, to link a catpass and a precision together. And so it's all just my theory, or whatever, but this is kind of the way I'm trying to, I would love to eventually visually be able to describe and show these, like, you know, these roots, these branches, these constellation, connections, however, you want to say, you know, what it means, of how each movement is related and can help each other because for me, the thing that I kind of go to with teaching somebody movement is like, how close is it to their fear zone, you know, there's their comfort zone, their work zone and then their fears zone, if you can practice four of the five parts of a new move in a way that is in their work zone or their comfort zone, then, without even trying that move, it's invariably going to shift further from the fear zone into that comfort zone, as long as they didn't have a prior negative experience with it, you know, I do this a lot with my, my backflips, I have a sequence sequence of teaching that I'm really happy with and I get probably 80% of the people doing a backflip on their first day of the class, just because it's getting real comfortable with each piece of the backflip. And then after the three pieces of the backflip are understood, the only new addition is connecting, you know, the first and the second piece so there's that new part and there's the second and the third piece there's that new part of them and so they've already done three fifths of the movement and then just have to put it all together you know.

18-interviewer
Is that, the stuff you just showed me? Is that on the website already? Or is that to be published?

18-participant
This one is not published just yet but there's there's some basic stuff for, right now I'm working on a games page and as you know I'm going to Dubai, I'll be working a lot more there, not on the website sadly but I'll be trying to get stuff added, the thing is my friend is Portuguese, is Brazilian and I'm English and so he has been, had a little bit more time to add some stuff but he's also doing the translations in Portuguese so if you write something in English I usually go over to edit it you know what I mean? And then post it up so that's kind of the thing we're just waiting on right now but but if you're interested I can give you the, I have your email I can give you like a membership so you can look through through it all and see as we start to add new stuff.

18-interviewer
Yeah, I mean, whenever it's whenever it's available if, I don't know if I can like follow follow you on Twitter or something just to be notified or if you would kindly drop me an email or something, just, that'd be, I'd be really interested in looking through that once it's available. Cool. Okay.

18-participant
Sorry, we went long this time.

18-interviewer
It's all good. Yeah, it's been great. Really, really useful. Yeah, if, again, if there's anything else you want to add, please feel free otherwise, I think I think I'm happy and we can, we can wrap up.

18-participant
I'd say just the only thing just to not beat a dead horse or whatever, it's just the thing, that's the thing that I'm always trying to do with with the catpass, especially as it's slightly more here in this movement for people, right, is to, to psychologically make it more attainable first, while you know, building it up physically if they as long as they have the physical ability right. For them to psychologically achieve a little bit before they're having to achieve it in the real world. Right. And so it's through these visualisations and progressions, that they're completing the movement in more comfortable ways that they then can start to, you know, by doing a catpass a tonne of times on a picnic table, and clearing their hands, they're invariably catpassing over an obstacle already. That's, you know, whatever the length of the distance that clearly. So I think this is a huge piece, and you see people doing it already, intuitively, you know, what I mean, but I think this is a, this is something worth talking about for, for new coaches, for newer practitioners and stuff like that, that, you know, because for every person that I've seen, take a movement and break it down beautifully, and progress it nicely. You know, you have how many people say just do it, jump higher, push harder, you know, and it's like, this is a mindset that I don't think is the most applicable or the most sustainable in the teaching aspect.

18-interviewer
It's, is there, just to almost play devil's advocate. Is there any element of that in the kong vault though? You know, it is a dive, there is a slight component of commitment. You know, I wouldn't ever say, just do it. But yeah, there is an element of that first one, you kind of got to commit, right?

18-participant
Yeah, for sure. I definitely agree. I think it's like that being said, it's like, it's like kick starting, not kick starting. It's like push starting a car. Right? You want, maybe, maybe it'll never, you know, the catpass won't be, okay, you just got to take the brakes off, you know, and you're already coasting downhill and do the movement. But, you know, you're trying to make that angle that they have to push that dang car, before they can kickstart it less and less, because at first, you know, they're like, trying to kick, you know, they're trying to push start a car up a hill, and instead, they're just gonna get run over by the car, right? And so how, how can we make that push that they they have to commit? You're right, it's a, it's a dynamic movement, there's no, you know, unless you're hella strong, there's no like freezing halfway. You know, you have to let go, you have to be completely in the air at a certain point of the movement, which you have to do for lots of parkour stuff. So they do eventually, yeah, have to just do it. But I think the, you know, there's, there's still closer that people can get to that before and to the comfortable idea that before they're just hucking it, you know what I mean? But, I mean, I learned it by hucking it, right. And there's people that still do and it's fine. So, you know, it's, it's finding out what works for them. Right. And I definitely, that kid that in, that kid that unconsciously, subconsciously, didn't even try, but he showed me a better technique. You know, I didn't teach him a catpass. I showed him the catpass. I gave him one or two tips. He did it first try. I mean, I've had students where they've been working on their catpass for months, you know what I mean? And sometimes it's physical barriers. Sometimes it's mental barriers, right. And and so definitely not talking trash about the just do it version, but I find it used more often than it's useful.

18-interviewer
You can kind of progress people to a point where, just do it is kind of the appropriate advice rather than being like, just do it, and it's dangerous advice.

18-participant
Exactly. My last experience with this exact thing where I'm telling the person just to do it is I've been working backflips with a lady for six months att least. Then she's every time she's been asking like, you know, she's like, okay, so okay to do this with my arms, I don't need to do this. I'm like, you're doing the backflip for six months, you're good. Now you're just getting inside your head too much. You know what I mean? You need to know like, okay, you're doing a backflip, and then commit to it. And then yeah, just do it. Because at this stage, her, you know, the neural pathways are more connected, she knows what to do with the arms, what you know, then the knees come up, what happens after the knees? And yeah, there's a certain stage where like, we can get in our own way mentally, right? If you look at anything, right, anybody that's a master of something. When they're learning that thing, their brain is super, super active, as they've mastered it, the brain is less active, because it's more in the subconscious mind that's making it happen. And so at a certain point, with this, I think that's exactly what you got to do. I mean, I know, I don't often think about how I'm doing the catpass I just think do a catpass, at this stage. And so I think it's it's valuable and important to do that. But there's a time and a place, right. And you got to be kind of intuitive and empathic to understand at what point is that doing good or more harm than good, right.

18-interviewer
All right. I think I'm going to stop us there [laugh] Otherwise, it's going to be a massive transcription. It's great. I really appreciate it. And I appreciate your time, but yeah, unless there's anything else I think, I think I'll stop the recording.

18-participant
Nah I think I'm done [laugh]
