There we go. So, yeah, so the study really is just looking at how kind of parkour coaches understand some of the movements that we do. And how they've kind of come to understand them how they describe some of the movements. Because you know, Parkour is kind of spread organically and kind of decentralised. And so I'm just really curious about how these things have kind of transmitted, and help people understand them, describe them, things like that. And I just picked the Kong vault as kind of like a really common movement that seemed like a lot of people would know. So I guess the first question really is, is the term Kong vault familiar to you? Is that the phrase that you use to describe it?

17-participant
Yeah, so we generally use Kong vault in my area, I would say the only like, weird distinction we have is we call it a monkey when you don't go fully over. So if you're just getting like using it to get on top of something, we refer to it as a monkey vault. But Kong vault is generally what we call it. And especially like when you're going fully over an obstacle.

17-interviewer
I've heard that kind of, is it just getting the feet up on top to kind of replace the hands?

17-participant
Yeah, yep.

17-interviewer
That's monkey. I've heard that referred to as like a Kong up or a pop up as well?

17-participant
Yeah. So we'll call we usually call them like monkey ups. So that's, like, we have the Kong vault. Sometimes it's referred to as the monkey vault. But generally amongst like, the coaches, at least we call it a Kong vault, with students, sometimes it's more of like monkey vault just because they're like, Kong doesn't mean anything to them. And we're like Kong, monkey, Monkey vault. When you're working with kids, slightly easier to explain, but.

17-interviewer
Right. And how would you just kind of in very broad terms describe, describe the movement?

17-participant
Yeah, um, so I would describe it as getting over an obstacle using your hands only. And you're continuing in a forward orientation, so you're not turning or twisting your body. And then as you're pushing past the obstacle, the feet are going between the hands. Exiting, you can either, of course, land, two feet, one foot, but ideally, if you're trying to add it into the route, keeping it smooth two foot takeoff, or sorry, the one two take off once you're landing.

17-interviewer
Okay. I mean, you mentioned the takeoff and landing and things there. If you're going to kind of break it down into stages, almost, like are there common ways to take off, common ways to land? You started describing them but-

17-participant
Um, there's lots of variations in terms of takeoff and landing. So we colloquial, colloquially referred to it as the punch takeoff when you're taking off with two feet. And then the one two take off when you're doing two, multiple steps. And that lets you swing your leg up for more height from the hips, and a smoother exit. And then of course, you can do your Kong pre landing with two feet in like that precision type of landing, or doing that one two exit to continue moving forward. Generally, when I'm teaching it, I don't necessarily start with the takeoffs and landings because when I break it down, I start with just working on getting the hips higher than the head, because that seems to be at least especially with kids, but generally with people, well, anyone who isn't already comfortable throwing themselves at things, the thing a lot of people get stuck on is the kind of head first motion and getting their hips above their head tends to be the thing that really, is difficult for people mentally.

17-interviewer
Is it, is that just the mental side of it, or is it a physical challenge as well?

17-participant
.I think that depends on the person. It's a little bit of both, I would say it's definitely with kids a lot more mental, with adults, sometimes that is like a mobility issue. But it's also the coordination of trying to, you know, use your arms to get your hips because that's not a movement that we're necessarily used to using, especially as adults in our modern world, you don't really have many scenarios where you're trying to pop your hips up above your head. So that can kind of take some doing and working on just, you know, getting comfortable in that position on the floor like working almost like handstand hop up donkey kick type of things, just to get used to allowing them to rise. Because the mistake that you see very often is people like kicking their legs out and back. So their hips don't actually rise and their head stays up or if you're going over an obstacle that's lower people kind of frog hop over it and stay in the same orientation of like head to hips, and you're just like jumping over it, I'm like okay, you didn't exactly use your arms there so it's not going to translate when you've got a taller obstacle.

17-interviewer
So just kind of tapping it with the hands as they go over, but really they're just box jumping it.

17-participant
Touched it and then jump, well, yes you did use your hands, unfortunately that won't quite help you a little bit later on. 

17-interviewer
Is the something of take it to the hands should be doing in that case on the obstacle?

17-participant
Yeah so with the hands working on the push, I like to do that on the floor because that's a little bit less scary and you tend to have to like work with that push or using like a really low like precision trainer type of obstacle to kind of start with the reach into the push and that's another one with doing the monkey ups or just getting your feet on top of the box is a really nice one for that because that kind of forces you to move your hands out of the way and really get that push. That one sometimes helps people with hips, sometimes not because some people have the mobility to just kind of like bring their legs up underneath them but I like that one to get the push, pushing with those hands because that's kind of you know one of the many pieces that you have to put together. You got to get the hips high enough so that they can go through the hands, hands need to push as the legs come back down.

17-interviewer
Is that push creating space for the legs to come through or is it pushing behind you to get you to go further? Or both?

17-participant
It's a little bit of both, more the hips rising is more what's creating the space for the legs so the higher you can get the hips the more space you're giving yourself now, like I said some people just have the like hip mobility to tuck themselves up really tiny so they don't necessarily need the hips quite as much in some scenarios but that's kind of like then you're stuck with that so I like to try to teach really trying to raise those hips to give yourself space. The push is a little bit, I tend to think about that yes you need the push to help raise yourself but you also need that to come back to standing so you don't like Naruto run out of it.

17-interviewer
So that kind of helps you reorient yourself to upright.

17-participant
Exactly. Yep, it's like in the lache, when you do the throw to set yourself back up this is the kind of the kong version of that if you will.

17-interviewer
So just to come back to the takeoffs, you mentioned the punch and the split foot?

17-participant
Yeah.

17-interviewer
What kind of effect do they have? What's the difference between the two?

17-participant
Yeah, um, so with the punch takeoff I think of that more as if I'm thinking in terms of like a parabola that's going to be a taller parabola so you might be able to get over something taller because you're just going more up and straight down. If you're trying to go for height and distance that's when the split foot becomes really helpful because you can kind of punch from each foot and then swing your leg up behind you to lift your hips a lot higher. So that's, the punches, you're just jumping your hips high enough but it kind of is like halts all of your momentum, the split foot is when you're carrying the momentum through that gives you a lot more distance and power but tends to be trickier to coordinate for a lot of people so that tends to be like, you learn the punch first to be able to get over and then okay now you've got that now let's talk about splitting your feet swinging your leg to do all of that. I should I guess also mention with the takeoff, we call it the dip when you're kind of like getting a little lower to take off so that push starts the motion with the legs so the push is kind of at the beginning throughout and at the end, but getting lower to the obstacle to give yourself more of a spring into it you can like bend your legs and bend your arms to get more power.

17-interviewer
So it's kind of like any other jump, you come down before you go up, to get more power.

17-participant
Exactly. Yep. But that's a lot of, it's tricky because sometimes you're so focused on getting over it that you don't necessarily think about like you come at it and you're already trying to rise you need to dip into it in order to get over it.

17-interviewer
Does that affect the parabola that you describe? The arc over the obstacle?

17-participant
Yeah it's kind of the way to I guess, without, the dip is more of a split foot thing so that gives you kind of the power you would get with the punch while still getting the split foot because you're coming down and rather than going you know a wider arc, you're coming down to come up and over, and then you can get more push to get further. So it's kind of, I guess it wouldn't be a parabola, I don't know the math term for an uneven parabola, but [laugh] you get the idea.

17-interviewer
And so what, what kind of obstacles is it used on? Obviously, I know that there's going to be a huge amount that you could potentially be used on. But are there the general types of things that people go ah, that's, that's good for konging? I'm probably, that's a terrible question [laugh]

17-participant
[laugh] I, I see what you're saying.

17-interviewer
I mean, in terms of things like height and width and stuff, not you know, oh, this block or that block, like, general characteristics.

17-participant
Right. Um, I mean, it tends to be like vaultsable wall type stuff, although that's why I think like, practising actually the Kong up or monkey up is really good, because then that gives you a little bit more variance of what you can use with it, but I also really like ground Kongs, and like, just using that motion on the ground, but the typical thing is, you know, you know, like hip, to waist height wall, going up and over. I mean, depending on your skill level, I look at something chest height and go hmm, probably not gonna be able to get over that very easily with a Kong. But for some people, that's like, cool, no issue, could do that. I do think really short Kongs can be fun, because you kind of have to change your technique. But that's not like a typical use. That's more just quirky, just playing around.

17-interviewer
I mean, short as in height, like, low down.

17-participant
Yeah, like the lower to the ground, because you have to kind of change your technique a bit and working distances, that is interesting, because you're not able to get that kind of dip in your takeoff. So in some ways, it can be harder than some of the like more standardised ones. But that tends to be like I said, that's not a typical use. That's like, just messing around playing with different ideas. But like I said, I think it can be a lot more versatile than we think about it very often because you got your monkey ups, your ground Kongs, like using it in lots of different situations, not just over a wall. And of course, then precisions as well, adding on to the end of it. So.

17-interviewer
So in terms of landing, you're trying to land on something on the other side?

17-participant
Exactly. So it's not just getting over and continuing moving but trying to Kong over and then land and stay there and stick that landing on something precise. Whether that's a curb, just the ground or a railing or something you know. And then of course, pushing that further, you can do kong cats, Kong, Kong into plenty of different variations of things.

17-interviewer
Is that something that's useful about the Kong compared to maybe some other vaults? That you can connect it to a lot of other stuff?

17-participant
Yeah, or in an in a different way, I think it's a little bit easier, in some ways to precision, like jump and land out of it, just because your body stays in that forward orientation, rather than having to like turn or twist or reset yourself. And same with the going into a cat leap. When you're, you know, aiming for a wall and trying to catch on to it. You're already in that forward orientation. So you don't have to work with any kind of twists. Like if you're trying to do one of the other coaches at the gym, I work I was messing around with reverse vaults to cats where you're completely twisting your body. And now you're dealing with forces pushing you sideways while you're trying to catch on to a wall that's forward, which makes that much, much more difficult. The Kong is nice, because you're already heading in that direction. Everything is set up the way you needed to be. You just need to get your feet out in front of you which the Kong vault works well for when done correctly.

17-interviewer
Yeah, I like that. So that kind of always staying in that almost linear motion, straightforward. How about in comparison then to like a dash vault? Because that's similar that you're going very forwards. Is there a difference?

17-participant
Yeah, so the dash vault instead of... the Kong vault is all about hands first. And that was kind of one of for me, the tricky parts of learning it was I felt like I had to dive into it. You have that diving motion. And depending on what you're trying to do, your feet need to leave the ground before your hands are on the box. Dash vault is pretty much you're jumping over it. So your feet are going first and then your hands are pushing off behind you. So you still have that same type of orientation. It's just, and like the push all that stuff. You need all the same pieces. It's just a different order, if you will, as opposed to hand starting first, your feet are going first. Otherwise, they're kind of pretty similar. It's like the I'm facing upwards towards the ceiling or facing downwards towards the floor.

17-interviewer
And how about in terms of things like that getting to a precision or something like you mentioned. Is it, because the Kong just lets you get more distance or something like that?

17-participant
Yeah, I think with the Kong vault just because of how it's set up, at least for most people, you can produce a lot more power. Because it's easier to push, where you're struggling, you get the full push from hands in front of you, two hands behind you, and bring those feet through, getting a lot more distance. Whereas the dash vault, it's kind of limited by how far you can jump because you're essentially jumping over it and you do get a push, but you get a lot less of a push, you've got so much less range of motion when you're starting the push behind you. And you can only go as far as your arms extend behind as opposed to starting in front. And doing the entire way through the dash vault is like the last half or a third of the push that you're going to get from a Kong vault. So you can apply it to similar situations, but I don't think it's your, you're going to be able to get as much power. So if you're going for distance kong vault, it's going to be your better bet.

17-interviewer
So one of the things I'm really curious about is you know, you've mentioned there's a couple of different takeoffs, different ways you can land come out of it. There's, you know, other things kind of within the Kong family movements, like I've heard some people describe, like, diving Kongs and double Kongs. Yeah. What is it that kind of makes something a Kong? I know it's a bit of an abstract question. But if there's all these things you can change in it, what are the things that have to stay the same to be able to go, yeah, that's a kong.

17-participant
That's a good question. Um, I guess I think about it as the hands are like... the orientation staying the same. So you're still continuing in that forward movement. And you're not adding in any twists or anything necessarily, the hands are still reaching out in front, you're getting the full push, and the feet are still coming through the hands. So you're still getting a jump. So when you're doing like a dive kong or a level Kong, you're still your body's gonna stay in that same orientation, you're just applying it to different obstacles and scenarios. So the movement remains the same. It's just the environment in which you're doing it is different. So with like a double Kong, now, you're just doing it twice before your feet hit the ground. But otherwise, the mechanics of the movement are staying the same, your hands are still leading, your hips still need to get height, arguably higher for a double Kong, your feet are still coming through, you're still landing on your feet. I guess you could argue like Kong to roll or Kong to flip or something. But even with those, you're still going to have like hands leading feet staying within that orientation, they're not going out to the side or anything like that. So I think it's mostly just the orientation and like the movement itself staying the same, and applying it to various situations.

17-interviewer
Is it the kind of movement pattern over the obstacle itself-

17-participant
Exactly.

17-interviewer
- thatkind of middle, middle portion almost.

17-participant
Yeah, mechanically, like what you're doing is the same, you're not changing, you know where your feet are going, or whether your feet or hands are going first, based on the obstacle you're doing, you're taking, okay, you're doing hands, hips rise, feet through, landing, or continuing running or staying put. But all of like that is the same as to how I apply it to this obstacle, whether it's like a height thing, or I'm diving across a gap. Or, you know, going into a flip afterwards, that section of the movement remains the same.

17-interviewer
Do you think that's quite a natural movement, or something we have to learn, or?

17-participant
Interestingly, I think I think it depends on the person and kind of your movement history. Because some people have no issue at all learning it. And some people like myself, it took me several years to kind of get used to that, because I really had a problem with like diving for it and popping my hips high enough and trusting like my push would be enough. So I think it kind of depends on your personal movement experience, if you are not comfortable doing any kind of like headfirst type of thing. Or, if you just are like returning to movement and having done a lot of movement, that can be kind of tricky. But then there's like the people who have done all kinds of sports and stuff that tend to have less of a problem with it. And some of that I think is just having the correct amount of body awareness because it does take a lot of coordination and you really have to like know your timing, especially when you're working with like the split foot and exiting and all of that. And there is a certain amount of body confidence, because you need the momentum. Particularly, I'm pretty short, I'm about five, five feet one inch. So when I'm going over something that's a little bit taller, like I really need to have that momentum, and you have to have the confidence to be able to run at something and make sure you can get over it. And you know, people have visions of clipping their feet. And you know, the all of the classic Kong bails are just not quite getting there. And then having to deal with, now my head is the thing aiming towards the ground.

17-interviewer
Yeah, I think you mentioned earlier that kind of inversion aspect of it, getting the hips up.

17-participant
Yep, exactly.

17-interviewer
Is it tonight, learning to trust your arms as much as your feet a little bit as well?

17-participant
I think it's definitely that. And I think it's partly just getting comfortable inverting, whether that's like handstands rolls, flips. Any kind of rotation, if you're not used to that, I think takes a lot of getting used to because that's not necessarily in the standardised movement vocabulary that most humans do. It's like running cool, walking, cool. But that's all in an upright orientation, when you're changing that orientation and asking people to either go like headfirst or to rotate, or, you know, go upside down, that's a lot trickier for people even just like hanging upside down on a railing from their knees or like hanging across their waist, can be really tricky for people because that feeling of falling. That has a lot to do with just getting a certain amount of trust that you're not just going to fall and having getting your hips high enough, you often feel like you're going to fall. So definitely trusting the arms, but just trusting your body in different positions and getting used to that in order to build the trust. So just finding, getting comfortable, if you will.

17-interviewer
Yeah, that there's definitely a degree of like, I mean, you mentioned momentum earlier, there's there's some commitment you have to really go in to the movement with. Because once you've once you've dived, you can't really, really change your mind, right?

17-participant
There's a couple aspects, I think are really mental about the Kong because like I said, there is the mental aspect of like, it's not necessarily a way that we orient our bodies. Normally, you have to get comfortable with allowing your hips to get higher than your head. Depending on your level of comfort, comfort with diving. Like I said, I had a really like difficult mental struggle with that, allowing my hips to get high enough because I was head first and the fear of falling. And then of course, the problem is, you're more likely to fall when you have less commitment, and less momentum. And when you do something weird at the last second because you go wait, wait, wait, I changed my mind, I don't want to do this. That's when you're more likely to get hurt. So that commitment is huge and extremely mental because you have all these other aspects that you're thinking about, not to mention, like, you know, coordinating the physical aspects to get the timing right to actually make it up and over. I feel like there's a certain amount of baggage that can come with that when especially teaching it to adults who haven't necessarily done movements like that in a while. That's one that a lot of people kind of tend to struggle with.

17-interviewer
You mentioned you know, your own experience learning it a little bit. Where, where did you learn it? Did you teach yourself? Do you go to classes?

17-participant
Some of both. I started out, training in like unofficial classes with, it happened to be with a bunch of people who also coached so I wasn't like totally on my own having no idea what I was doing. But it wasn't a specific taught class. It was a bunch of people who were training. So at the point when I started learning Kongs, I was, I had started then going to actual classes, but did a lot of training outside of classes as well. So it's some of both and a lot of my friends at that point were coaches. So I'd be like, Okay, can you look at this and tell me what I need to do and trying to figure out how to work out this split foot, it took me a long time I got the punch first, and then spent a long time trying to figure out how to split my feet on the takeoff and the exit to kind of smooth it out and get a little better and you know, give myself more range of what I could get overtop of and that was really working on building the momentum and coordinating how the legs work. So working on drilling a lot of things sometimes in class and then coming in or doing my own stuff outside of class either at open gym or at you know, outdoor training sessions and just spent a lot of time drilling things repetitiously [laugh]

17-interviewer
Is that kind of how you, what got you through to learning it, just just keep drilling and drilling it, or was there any particular tips or tips or tricks that you picked up that kind of unlocked it for you?

17-participant
Let's see. I don't have like a eureka moment with the kong vault specifically. Learning the dip definitely helped but I had to learn the split foot first so I spent quite a long time actually trying to get the split foot worked out and I think one drill that really kind of helped me was ignoring the rest of actually getting over the box just trying to work on only the section of running up to the box and jumping and trying to split my feet and swing one leg so just drilling like only that section and not worrying about trying to do any of the rest of breaking it into kind of little pieces I think that was the thing that eventually got me to get that piece and then once I kind of had enough confidence during that being able to take it over the top. I do remember there was one moment with learning the exit where someone said to me because I kept landing with both feet kind of out in front so someone said to me at one point like kind of stick your foot back so I don't necessarily think about landing as hitting and running forward it's as I'm going one leg is going back down towards the floor and that's the first foot that hits and that lets it be one that one two kind of split foot exit. So I remember that was a really key piece for me was learning to kind of like rather than try to run forward stick one leg back to set up my split if you will.

17-interviewer
Was that kind of breaking the, the kind of habit of a precision landing almost where you have the feet out in front of you?

17-participant
Yeah.

17-interviewer
Getting them more underneath you?

17-participant
Yeah and just like allowing them to separate too, like okay, just just take one leg stick it behind you as you're starting to land and then I was like oh, that was apparently the the cue I needed to really be like okay now I understand how this works.

17-interviewer
Mm. And now do like the movement? Is it is it one you enjoy doing or do you still find it challenging in some way?

17-participant
Uh, I mean it's definitely still challenging but it no longer is like just getting over something challenging, I feel pretty confident at various heights so now it's working on, my current struggle is trying to get level kong pres, where I'm going over something and then landing on something the same height because for whatever reason they freak me out a lot [laugh] Shinned myself multiple times trying to practice it but I think just for that one I need to work on getting my hips higher than I normally would so that's the current struggle but that's the nice thing like we said about the variability of kongs is there's always like a next step or level you can work towards so once you get over and you're confident with that now you can work on kong precisions or kong cats or you know splitting your feet if you're still working on like the punch and land so there's tonnes of variations so I'm a lot more confident with just using it in general though I just, tend to still need to like if if I'm getting too close to an obstacle and I haven't planned what i'm doing I probably won't do a kong, I'm more likely to do something that's a little bit like, I need to still have some run up especially depending on the height of the obstacle so that's another thing I kind of want to work on is like my standing kongs have a limit in terms of height. Working on producing a little bit more power to vary the height that I can work that up.

17-interviewer
I'm really curious about what you said about it, needing to plan it a little bit to use it, so it's not quite an instinctive move yet?

17-participant
It depends... I think it depends on what angle I'm coming in, like if I know I have enough space then I'm like yes I'm going to do a kong but I need to know like I need to have enough space so I can do like my one two split if I'm, if I haven't thought about it enough or I'm coming in at a weird angle I'm going to be like I'm just going to do whatever, like fall back to doing some kind of step vault or lazy vault to get over because that's like when I'm closer to the obstacle I'm like okay that's the easier version to do. Especially I think with kongs because you have that diving motion like you need a little bit more space than some of the others like with lazy vaults same with like dash vaults I still need I still feel like I need a little bit more run up because you have to take off a little bit sooner whereas a lazy vault or thief vault or step vault you can be right beside the obstacle. So just in terms of like the practicality of the movement, if I don't have enough space, that's not going to be my go to because my standing ones, like I said, there's there's a height limit [laugh]

17-interviewer
Is that a little bit of like, power generation required as well? You know, you need that little bit of... because what I initially think of is obviously, some people can seemingly do magical Kongs out of nowhere from standing still, is that just they're somehow able to generate the power?

17-participant
Yeah, I think that's a lot of depending on what you've trained or worked on. I know, one of my weaknesses is power generation, in all movements. I love like, flow and that kind of thing but I don't naturally and I haven't done a sport in my life that really requires a lot of like the fast twitch muscle. So that's something that I struggle with a lot more, whether it's like jumps or vaults, or anything, really, it's like when there is a need for a lot of power, I have a harder time with that. Whereas I have a friend who like did track in school. So he's got like ridiculous amounts of power and can jump ridiculously far and can do stupid things from standing. And I'm like, but that's, you know, based on his life experience and the things that he's done. He's really developed that and I haven't put in the time to really develop my fast twitch to a point that I can do some of that stuff. I mean, it's definitely better than it was. But I haven't specifically worked on that, and I don't naturally genetically have really strong or great fast twitch. So it ends up being like, okay, is that the thing I want to put the time into? Or do I want to practice like level Kong pres? Balancing act, you know [laugh]

17-interviewer
So as you, as you started to move into coaching, did you, did you have to like update your approach to the movement in any way in terms of teaching it? Did you, or are you teaching it essentially the same way you taught it? How's it kind of evolved over time?

17-participant
Yeah, I don't necessarily teach it the same way that I learned it. But that's also partly because the way that I learned is just like very repetitiously doing things. And I, most of the coaching I do is with kids, and when you just very repetitiously do things, they get bored. So there's a certain amount of like, you know, I was a little older when I started. And I was very invested in like, I'm going to do this until I can get it. Sometimes it's a good approach, not always, but um, I find with kids breaking it down into the individual pieces and getting them to work on the pieces and then slowly starting to put the pieces together works really well. And the other thing that I really feel is helpful... When you're working with adults who have a certain level of body awareness, you can give verbal cues of like, okay, you need to jump your hips higher and here's a way that you can do that. When you're working with kids, depending on the age, that doesn't mean anything to them, like they hear what you're saying. And they can't translate that into actually doing it. So something I like to use a lot, I use pool noodles a lot when I'm coaching kids at the gym, because that's a really low consequence way to kind of give them a physical cue of, okay, you need to get your feet like when you're jumping and pushing with your hands, your feet need to get over this noodle, or you're trying to jump and bop this noodle with your butt when you get your hips high enough. So they have that physical feedback, so they understand what it feels like. And I found that's a lot more effective with coaching kids. And I don't know, I didn't learn that way specifically, but maybe that would have been helpful for me as well. But giving that like physical visual feedback is really useful rather than just if you will, the the verbal feedback and being able to have them feel what it should feel like. You're like, okay, that's like, now I know what it should feel like so I can tell when I'm doing it wrong. And that's starting to build the body awareness for them.

17-interviewer
And has, that kind of those adaptations come about just from experience and you kind of thinking about it or do you as a coaching group that you're working with, do you guys talk about this stuff together?

17-participant
Oh, yeah, we definitely discuss things. We jokingly kind of are like, Oh, I found the thing that works! The thing is, nothing works for everybody. So you're constantly trying to like update, like okay, I tried this thing. And that worked for one or two people but not everybody or I tried this thing, it was a total flop but I think if I switch these things that it'll work so we discuss it and it's one of those you're just like okay, I'm looking at the situation and what most of the students need and going what is the next piece that I can do that's going to help them lift their hips higher and just slowly building the experience to be able to see what the next step that they need to get to start progressing and I think that's just comes from experience after a certain point of saying okay I didn't plan out specifically all the pieces I'm going to do because I want to see what we need to do and address that specifically.

17-interviewer
Are there are there still like common... you know, you mentioned, yeah you coach the individual, are there like common coaching cues I guess that you give to people with the kong, are there like common ways that seem to work for most people?

17-participant
Um, I like to use... I like to start with kind of ground kongs to start working on the push the trick with that being the leap frog of course and trying to like stamp out the leap frog but working with doing the monkey up first and talking about pushing and trying to replace the hands with the feet is one that works well for a lot of people. I also like to almost do like a little not handstand work but working on the donkey kick and hopping the hips higher to get that feeling in people's bodies, start with floor and then move that up to kind of boxes and when you can get people to realise that it's not kicking your feet outwards but trying to pop your feet upwards that can make a world of difference but that one, that one's like 50-50 depending on the age and coordination level of the people you're working with but I do very much like the popping the feet up to the box because then from there you can kind of work on popping over and pushing with the hands. Another one I like instead of going over a box or wall that's thinner is trying to work on something that's a little bit wider and pop your feet as far as you can because that really works the push and that works well for most people once they can get their feet on top of the box and then get the feeling of the push they'll start to like really get that and doing that before they have to worry about getting over I think helps a lot because then you're less concerned about what your feet are doing because you can see oh I'm getting them pretty far, further than what the width of this little box or wall is now that I can get over.

17-interviewer
So its kind of finding ways to teach people that, the movement pattern without that fear element of, I'm gonna fall on my face.

17-participant
Exactly it's, I think I like to progress the physical first because that then gives you the confidence to overcome the mental, tends to be like my way of doing it. I don't personally do well with like oh just go for it so I try to kind of progress people to gain confidence with their physical movements, be like yeah your body knows what to do now you just like you've proved to yourself that you can do it and now you just have to like okay I already know like the knowledge is there my body knows what to do the muscle memories there, so when I do it I should be okay, being able to kind of talk yourself into it tends to my approach. Which for the people like that I work with in terms of like, kids and like adult beginners are usually kind of my demographics, that tends to work pretty well. And like you always have like the one or two people who can look at you, see you do it and just do it, like wow you're a very strong visual learner of how the body works to like understand how to translate that but you're kind of teaching to the different types of learners, you've got the people who need the kinetic feeling of learning it, the people who need to hear you say that one thing that's going to make it click, and people will just look at you do it and then immediately be able to do it so [laugh]

17-interviewer
Do you think it's a, um... I've struggled to find the right word for this throughout all the interviews. Do you think it's like an integral parkour movement? Is it something that people should try and learn to do parkour? Should is a very strong word but...

17-participant
Yeah. I think that's that's interesting, I guess i think about it more like it's a classic parkour movement. Like it is iconic but when you're working like I teach... well I do like monthly kind of women's workshops and more most of the women who come to those classes are like 40 year old moms. And that's why I do kind of like a separate women's thing, because that's a space that they're comfortable coming to where it's not like, Okay, I'm not with a bunch of 20 something buff dudes, like this is like, you know, a safe space, so we're not going to be trying to throw down and do crazy things. So with them, I don't necessarily do that right away, especially if they're returning to movement after not having done that kind of thing. So I don't necessarily think it's, you have to be able to do a Kong to say that you do parkour, if you will. Because it's one of many, many different ways to get over an obstacle. Now, I do think it is like iconic and recognisable, and one of those things like that people who don't do parkour will see that be like, Oh, that's parkour, like, I know what that is. And depending on like your level of movement, of course, like, you want to learn that because it is useful. But there's plenty of other ways to get over walls. And that's not like a vault I would start people on, solely, because it does require a certain amount of power and coordination like that. More so I think, then obviously, like step vault, or some of the more basic ways to get over something that's especially when you're working with a population that doesn't necessarily have the inherent strength, or isn't comfortable trying to produce power, or is concerned about what might happen to them if they fall, I tend to focus more on Okay, let's build your confidence with other ways to get over a box. And then as we're doing that, we're building coordination, building that kind of thing. So I tend to start with like, step vaults and doing like the butt spin, like sitting on the box and swinging your legs over. And that I think, is a really nice way to start. Because that shows people hey, you don't have to be able to do these power moves to start. So that's kind of why I shy away from saying it's like, you can't like it's not integral to being able to do parkour. Because I want people to be able to see parkour and not go, Oh, I could never do that and not try it. So I have a little bit of bias in that sense, in that I'm, you know, the type of coaching I do is trying to get people involved in show them hey, like, I know, you saw people jumping across rooftops, in a video that you looked up on Google when you're trying to find out what this was. And we're not going to do that because you know, you you don't start jumping rooftops, you start on the ground jumping, like from pavement lines. So, I would say definitely classic and iconic, but not integral to doing parkour.

17-interviewer
It's funny, because I've heard some other people describe it as like, a basic vault. But you know, you were just talking about a population that it's actually more likely to be more of an advanced vault for them. So do you think do you think it is a basic vault, a basic movement in the parkour toolbox? Or does it depend on on the population? The individual?

17-participant
Yeah, I think about it, I guess like, your parkour. Like Parkour is such an individualised thing. For some people, that is going to be a basic vault. And that's the people who like have no issue learning that. For some people, like for me, now, it's part of my basic vault toolbox. But when I started, it wasn't, that was I didn't even learn that within the first few years of starting, because it's kind of intimidating. So I think it depends on where you're at with your parkour. I'm not going to ask a 43 year old mom who knows may not have the hip mobility or control or upper body strength to be able to get that push to kind of work on that. I want to get her to a point of feeling confident with other ways to get over a box and build that up. So I think it depends, like I said, on the person as what is you consider basic for yourself. It's, and honestly, we don't even teach that with our kids classes. That's not something that they that they learn until they get to our like, intermediate class, because it is one of the ones that's trickier to teach. And especially, well, especially with kids, there's a certain level you need to be at in terms of maturity and coordination. If they're too young, they have a really hard time learning certain things because it's too many things to keep track of. We see that even kind of originally trying to work on like lazy vaults with some of the younger ones, that can be really difficult for them and it's a matter of like development and coordination. So I wouldn't necessarily class like, class it as a basic vault for all populations. That's if you are in, I guess Parkour is very much skewed towards like 20 to 30 year old people who might inherently have the kind of power and body confidence to be able to do that, like they inherently have that athleticism. But if you're starting at a level that you don't have that athleticism, it's not going to be basic, and it's going to take time to learn. Because like I said, it is mental when you haven't worked in that way before or you're not comfortable going headfirst, or, you know, you got to work up the strength and the mobility to do it. So, I think as parkour has kind of grown, and the population of who's doing it has kind of changed. Some of our definitions have had to kind of broaden, I think, and like I said, definitely iconic. Definitely something everybody should work towards, because I do think it is a useful vault. And I think it's a really nice one to kind of intro with generally low consequence, some of the mental elements like that one can be pretty mental. But I don't think it's like, oh, if you can't do the Kong, you can't do parkour.

17-interviewer
Do you find... Hm. This is great in a way, because you've actually like, quite naturally moved on to a lot of the questions that I follow up with people. So I'm just thinking... Okay. Is there anything kind of about that Kong vault movement that you would like to know more about? Or that you're curious about yourself?

17-participant
Hmm. I mean, I'm always I'm always looking for different ways to like, cue it and try different things like as, as a coach, the different ways like hearing other people talk about movements, is really interesting. And I like to kind of hear how people describe them. Because that's useful to me to say, Oh, I hadn't thought of describing it that way. That gives me another tool in my toolbox for trying to help students understand kind of what they need to do and all of that, I feel like I have a pretty solid understanding at this point. But there's always plenty more to learn. I mean, for myself, I have like my own challenges, I'm working on level Kong pres, building more power, all that kind of thing. I guess I'm interested to see at least with the results of this study, kind of how people think about it. But I would love to know, I've talked with a lot of women about this, because like I said, I've done a lot of coaching of women. And actually a friend of mine, who was the one who sent me this study and was like, hey, you're a female coach, like go get in on this, I want to make sure we like have some representation, because I found, um, I feel not always but a lot of the time, women have a harder time learning it. And I think there's like a few pieces to that. But I'm, I'd be interested to find out more about kind of the potential gender divide of how people approach learning the Kong vault, or the difficulties or struggles they have, like the Kong vault. Like I have some theories, there's a certain amount of like, I think, anatomically, because women carry more weight and our centre of gravity is lower. That helps us with balance, but I think it's harder for Kong vault when like with medicine is like because your centre of gravity is in your chest. It's easier for you to lift your hips. But I also think it's a certain amount of like body confidence, competence and upper body strength, like, how we've been socialised in terms of our own personal thoughts about ourselves in an athletic way, and like our thoughts of our own capability. But I'd be really interested to learn more about that, especially like as a coach, who does teach women a lot. So.

17-interviewer
Have you found, have you encountered any of those kinds of attitudes in parkour do you think women are treated differently in the sport, in terms of teaching, teaching and coaching?

17-participant
I think it very much depends on the community. I was very lucky that the community that I stumbled upon was extremely, extremely respectful and treated me completely normally. And it was no big deal. Like they're doing giant jumps, and I am doing my tiny jumps on the sidewalk. Like that was never an issue and everybody was very supportive and just celebrated everybody's success, it didn't matter if you're jumping, you know, 2 feet or 12 feet, that was like everyone was, you know, had a very healthy community vibe, but I've also been to communities where I've visited and like, I did one pull up, and somebody was like, Oh, my God, a girl can do a pull up. And it was just like, um, so I think it very much depends on the community, and the leadership behind the community, because I think most often that has to do with a certain amount of exposure and the culture that is being created. And when you can create a culture that is inclusive, then you're going to, you know, have that kind of healthier culture, when you're not used to seeing women training. And then when they do, you don't know how to react, or people get, sometimes people are excited, which is great. But sometimes people get a little too excited, and then just want to like baby you and help you along. So there is kind of a right way of how to do that. But I think it depends on the community and the maturity of the leaders of that community and how they're kind of creating that culture and having conversations about it. Because I know that's, if people just don't know, like, they don't mean any harm, giving people unsolicited advice. But just because you don't intend any harm, doesn't mean there isn't some kind of harm that can happen from that.

17-interviewer
Yeah, I mean, that was kind of my next question is, is even in the inclusive welcoming communities or, or positive communities, have you, have you found any like, assumptions? Or, generally, you know, it's all guys doing it, doing parkour, have you found that, you know, they've been telling you things you just like, Yeah, that's great, if you're a guy [laugh] Or anything like that?

17-participant
Um, I do find, well, the reason that I am passionate about coaching women is because when I started, I was pretty much the only girl. So I did a lot of anything. Part of the reason I became a coach was because I did a lot of my own figuring out progressions and adaptations. I'm like, Alright, they're doing this really big jump that I definitely can't do. And I'm not even gonna attempt. So what can I do that's still like, training with them, but not the thing that they're doing. So I've found a lot of like, it's important to me to be able to help women get to that point, because I don't know, it's, it's tough to start that way. And, you know, you need a certain mindset to do it. And like, like I said, if I hadn't fallen into a community that was inclusive, it probably, I may not be here today, you know, 10 years later, I might not have done parkour at all. So, I do think there's, there's perhaps certain assumptions, but in an inclusive community, they tend to be if people have those assumptions, if your community is like healthy and has a good culture, people aren't going to put those assumptions on to you, per se. So you're not going to like, air,your assumption of like, oh, women do this thing. But there are certain like, tends to be observed behaviours, and I don't know if that's like a societal socialisation. I've seen like people discuss, like the way that women tend to jump, which is like kicking your feet behind you. I've heard people like call that a girl jump. That's I don't know. It just says a thing. Like, a lot of women tend to do apparently.

17-interviewer
I've not heard that. That's strange.

17-participant
Yeah. As opposed to like lifting the knees and reaching forward with the feet. It's lifting the knees, but kicking your feet behind you, and then having to bring them forward. Which, like I've seen it, I'm like, Okay, I understand what you mean. I didn't necessarily associate that as like a thing that women do. But so I've heard I've heard some, like, interesting kind of things with that. But I think it tends to be like more like, oh, women tend to be better balanced for this scientific reason. If you're in like, kind of a healthy community, or if you have particular thoughts about that. You just like don't air that to people. And that's, I think, the kind of healthier way to do it. But I think another healthy thing with communities is being able to discuss it in a respectful manner. Like because, like I said, I'm, I'm the only woman on the coaching team where I work. So being able to be like, yeah, like what you're doing doesn't work for me. This is what I do instead, and being able to have that I think especially since we're, we've had a lot of growth in the past few years with, like female students, especially with adults. So being like, me being able to be like, yeah, this is like, this is what the tall buff dudes are doing. And this is what I do, I think is a helpful thing, because then you don't necessarily have to find your own way to start out, especially in a coached environment, that can be kind of tricky. So and I think it does help the guys to have those conversations, because then they can be like, relate that to students as well and be like, oh, like, this is the way I do it. But I know that Melissa does it this way. So to have that experience of seeing, like, multiple things done in kind of varied ways, or the specific progressions that I tend to do for certain things for various people, I think is useful. So I think a key to that is being able to have like respectful conversations around those differences. Kind of a roundabout way to answer that question, but [laugh]

17-interviewer
And do you, I mean, you might not be able to answer this, but do you see that as something that's happening, is, are things improving in that way? Or is parkour still, all dudes all the time?

17-participant
I think it's definitely improving. Especially like, I mean, I started in like college. So it's a bunch of like, buff dudes doing things. And let's like, I don't know, you know, this was the perfect stereotype of a bunch of like, buff guys jumping on things, doing crazy stuff. But I think as it's grown, and especially as it's gotten older, and there's been more actual coaching, because I was not the type of person, a lot of the guys I know, there was like the YouTube generation who all learned from online videos, and I was not the person who was going to look at a video and be like, yeah, I think I'm going to try to chuck myself over this thing face first, you know. So I think as coaching has become more available, that has really kind of helped to shift the balance of things. And now a lot more people know what it is they know, like, there's a certain understanding of you don't have to have a certain physical basis to be able to start parkour that's slowly shifting, that's still like a battle that you have, which is like the person looking at and going, Oh, I could never do that. But I think that's starting to shift a little bit more, but at the same time you're still fighting against, as social media has gotten bigger, now, there's kind of like a balance between the coaching side where it's like, okay, I can go somewhere and learn how to do it and have somebody who knows what they're doing teach me. But then also the people seeing, you know, like, the Storror videos, and you know, all this stuff that have people doing crazy, insane things, and being like, Oh my god, like, that's parkour, there's no way. So it's kind of trying to find that balance. But I do think definitely, things have improved, there's been a lot more women, I think, getting involved and a lot more people who are older, like we're starting to slowly break out of the, you know, 20 something demographic, and that's, I think, in part to making it more accessible and, you know, starting at a point and what kind of what I would touched on before with Kongs, whether or not it's a basic vault, you know, be like it doesn't, you can do a Kong and do parkour, or you can not like there's your version of parkour and your level of parkour and you like, there's not a specific baseline that you must start at. So I think that as people have become more aware of that, and like I said, I think coach settings have made a lot of difference, when you can have someone to talk to you and give you specific feedback. Rather than looking at a video trying to do the thing. Looking at your video of you doing the thing, comparing it to the video. It lets you serve a lot more different learning styles and give people kind of a certain amount of I think there is like that mental security, if you will. Of like, Okay, I'm with someone who knows what they're doing. So I feel more comfortable doing this. They're not going to let hurt myself badly. Whereas, as I lovingly call it, when you're 20 something watching YouTube chucking stupid, like, you don't know [laugh] And that's like, someone who's 40 is not going to do that because they're like, man, if I break my hip, that's gonna be a problem for me. Yeah.

17-interviewer
Yeah. So kind of bring it back round to the Kong vault because that is in theory, what the study is about [laugh] Yeah, I really like that description of it, of it. Of not thinking of it as a basic vault or an advanced vault or anything like that, but just something you can learn and if you like it you keep going. You can make it more advanced if you want to, or or not. Just kind of leaving up to the individual.

17-participant
Yeah, that's I heard someone wants to describe it parkour as it's it's not like parkour, it's your parkour, like what you are doing is your parkour. And I think that's really important because it's so easy in parkour to fall into that comparison trap, and think, like, Oh, I'm no good, because I can't do X, Y, and Z. But you still have your particular parkour your strengths, your journey of what you're working on, and maybe the Kong vault is part of that, or maybe you're working on ground Kongs. But there's, the beauty of Parkour is there's a way to adapt, not everything, but nearly everything. So that it's accessible to people, wherever they happen to be a,t it's not, you have to have a certain level of strength to do this thing. It's like, okay, you don't have the strength to do this thing. So we're going to start here and build that strength. It just has so many nice adaptations for everything. Part, I think, if you're only watching, like, you know, videos of really advanced athletes, you don't see that quite as much.

17-interviewer
Yeah. The thing I find really curious about that is, you know, it's this wide open thing, you can make it what you want. Then contrasting that with coaching, where you kind of need some structure to pass along.

17-participant
Yeah.

17-interviewer
Right? Is that fair to say?

17-participant
[overlap] Yeah.

17-interviewer
So kind of contrasting those two things.

17-participant
I think the interesting thing with that, so we kind of talked about before, like what actually constitutes a kong, like the particular movement pattern and the order in which you do things. So it's, it's back to that idea of adjusting it to whatever you're going to work on. So whether you're doing you know, Kongs, dive Kongs at like 10 feet high, and then you know, landing and rolling out or you're doing just like little monkey hop, the ground Kongs, you can still take that motion and kind of adjust, okay, I'm going to do this just on the ground, no consequence, or I'm going to do this very high consequence, need to stick my landing, you know, have to don't want to clip my feet on this one, type of idea. So as long as you're doing those kind of that particular movement pattern, that's still going to be your Kong. And that's like where progressions come into it. So that's what coaching, coaching done well, is not just I'm going to show you this thing, and now you try. But that's why breaking the movement apart into pieces, working on specific bits, putting it back together, progressing through each of those is really key. And that's what allows you to keep the integrity of the movement and adapt it to pretty much any scenario.

17-interviewer
Yeah, I like that word, adapt. Like, there's a basic movement pattern that you can kind of... well yeah, adapt it to the environment, to the individual...

17-participant
Yep. So as long as like you're working that particular like, okay, here's like a drill working on keeping your knees between your hands. Like that's still working on the Kong, but that's at, you know, the level of someone working on the mobility to be able to, you know, lift their hips and keep their knees inwards as opposed to the person who's You know, I'm diving across a huge space, or I'm doing my Kong to cat to, you know, wall flip or whatever.

17-interviewer
So, do you think that those kind of patterns... I really like the word, classic parkour movement, I'm definitely stealing that. But it's this like collection of things that people you know, you go to a class, there's like a collection of movements, they've got names. There's certain ways you're coached them. Like, there's, there's some structure to it, but you can adapt it in a lot of different ways.

17-participant
Yeah, well, and I think different communities have done different things. So like, it tends to all be colloquial after a certain point. Because I know I've visited other communities and they're like, Oh, yeah, we're doing this movement. And I'm like, the what? And they do it like, Oh, yeah, this thing. We call it this, like, so. There's plenty of like, kind of sharing in that. And that's why I think travel is one of the things that's really important to parkour because there are tonnes of ways that people have done things as it's kind of grown in kind of little spaces and then expanded from there. So I think you, yeah, being able to have like, there are like the classic bases, basic things that we think of as parkour. But then there's like tonnes of stuff that people make up all the time. And that's, you know, I would say still part of their parkour as well, you can decide if your parkour includes flips or whatever. So there's no reason you can't decide if it's going to include Kong vaults, depending on the level of where you're at.

17-interviewer
And do you think those kind of classic movements that kind of like, yeah, classic toolset kind of emerged because they've just proven to be particularly useful, and they've just kind of survived, whereas perhaps other stuff has come and gone? Is there, is it like, is there like a core set of movements that are kind of like, these are really useful, we've passed them on, but you can do what you want around it?

17-participant
I think it's a combination of what's useful, and also some of what was done first. Because we're young enough that we still can see our roots. So it's like, oh, these were like, here's X, Y and Z original movements. So like, that's, these are in the parkour Hall of Fame. Like everybody knows what the Yamak did, and like, Kong vault were part of that. So that's why I call it like, classic and iconic. Um, so I think a lot of it kind of stems from that. But then there's people who are like innovating and doing all kinds of crazy stuff, and like, how can I combine this roll with this vault, and you know, like, it's, it's constantly evolving. So there's a certain amount of creativity and I think the basics are considered like the the basics or the classics, because they were the first things. And they are like, the building blocks, if you will, you can, there's a lot you can do from them. Whereas some of like, a lot of the newer, really creative stuff is like, okay, you have to have a certain basis in like acrobatics, to be able to replicate that. So I think that kind of has to do with like, okay, these are the originals, the building blocks, this is therefore what people know, they're super useful. And then you can add flourish to it. So I feel like a lot of the newer kind of creative stuff is like, you still use those building blocks. And then what can I add to them or tweak about them? But yeah, the usefulness definitely, is part of it. But again, I do think it has to do with, it was the original things that people did. So that's like, what parkour was. We're not gonna be like, oh, we're throwing out this vault, like, the founders are still alive, for heaven's sake, you know, like, we're way too young to start kind of trying to pick and choose in that way. Just as a sport in general, I feel. And I mean, the founders were all about usefulness, specifically. So that's, like, part of why, like, those movements are still around is like, Oh, yeah, this is really useful, like, doing, you know, metres and metres of QM sucks, but you're going to get real strong, and it's going to help you with like, all of these different movements. So that's why it's still around, not maybe not as flashy is doing a double backflip. But you know, that's still like a necessary part of it.

17-interviewer
Yeah, these things have kind of proven themselves over time. And so they get passed on.

I like that description of building blocks. I think that's, that's a good way to think about. Um, I'm aware of the time, I don't want to take up your entire day. Is there anything else that you, that's maybe popped in your head at any point or any thoughts that we didn't get to or anything else you'd like to add?

Uh, trying to think, I mean, I think I think we kind of hit on everything that I wanted to, just like the basics talking about different populations learning Kong vault, that was one I wanted to make sure to hit on, just based on like my experience, and a lot of the like, women I know who have learned it versus the experience of men learning it versus the experience of you know, older or younger populations. So I think I think we pretty much hit on everything that I had in my head is like this is an important kind of piece. So.
