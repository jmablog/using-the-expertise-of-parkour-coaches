2,1,interviewer,"All right. So I guess just to kind of explain a little bit about the study, just to give you a little background, I know you read the information sheet, as well. I'm just basically looking to talk to people, coaches and people who have coached in the past as well, about the way that they kind of understand some techniques in parkour. And in particular, I've picked the Kong Vault for this one, just because it's quite a kind of iconic parkour movement. Trying to think about how people understand these movements when there isn't like a central governing body or rulebook, judging guidelines, things like that, that you might get in other sports. So I mean, like, I guess the first thing to check is, do you know what I mean by the term Kong vault is that the term you're familiar with?",620,145
2,2,participant,"That was the term I would use for a two handed, legs go through your shoulders [laughs] I'm trying to describe I mean, my legs, my shoulders, but but my weight goes on to both hands. And then my legs follow through the middle, rather than like the side or that's what I would, that's the name that I would call it. I know that some people call it a catpass as well. But generally, the Cat, Cat things tend to be a bit muddy, confused.",331,86
2,3,interviewer,How so?,5,2
2,4,participant,"Well, just like what's a cat pass? And then there's a cat leap? And then there's a... Yeah, I think my memory was that the French would come over and translate things directly from the French and then we'd all be confused about what was a cat?",185,47
2,5,interviewer,"Because it was saut de chat, in French?",30,8
2,6,participant,[overlap] Mm.,9,2
2,7,interviewer,"Yeah. So I guess cat, it became catpass from that, but we generally would know it, as Kong vault.",74,19
2,8,participant,"Yeah, because a cat leap would be leaping to a cat position, of which I've rarely seen a cat being... Yeah.",80,21
2,9,interviewer,[overlap] Okay.,11,2
2,10,participant,I would call that a kong.,19,6
2,11,interviewer,"So I mean, you started, you started doing so already. But how would you just kind of describe that movement? In that case? The kong vault? What do you think is kind of like the, the meaningful identifying features of it?",172,41
2,12,participant,"I think it's the even distribution of weight on both hands, shoulders coming over the hands and the hips up high. And then pulling through with those hands so that your legs follow, follow afterwards? I think I would say that's the most defining feature because taking off and landing can vary. In that you could take off two feet together, you could take off staggered, you could like you could land in any, any way really. The movement, to me is about that... The weight coming on to the hands, the hips being quite high. And then I'm thinking, what, the reason I'm stuttering a bit is I'm thinking does this sound like a dash? And it, er, cuz you know what, by saying Oh, your hands, your weights on your hands, you could, that could sound the same, but your, your shoulders and your weight is moving first rather than your, and your legs follow? As I guess a dash is your legs going first.",692,167
2,13,interviewer,"Yeah, I mean, I'm aware, you know, I'm obviously asking you to describe something very visual. So is it, is it kind of the hands go on to the obstacle first?",118,31
2,14,participant,"Yeah. [laughs] The hands go onto the obstacle first. And the, I would say that your hands are the thing that is the most in front of you at the beginning of the movement, and then they take your weight, er, and then your hips and legs follow. So you're leading with your hands.",213,54
2,15,interviewer,"And what kind of, what kind of thing would you be doing that on? Does that affect the movement?",74,19
2,16,participant,"Yeah, so, I mean, if you were doing it on a, say it tends to be on things like low walls, erm, wouldn't have to be low, but like a wall... I mean, it could be a rail. That would, would, that wouldn't really change the movement, though, apart from the use of the hand. So you might pull with the fingers more around a rail, if you've got a grip of the rail. Yeah, I mean, you can also kong... I'm trying to think now like, I would say, you could also it's not a Kong vault if you did it on the ground. But it's like a, it's actually quite a lot like a bunny hop, isn't it? Well, no, it's not because your feet go all the way through. But you could be standing on a wall and kong down to another wall. So that the thing doesn't always have to be higher than you.",558,158
2,17,interviewer,"So this... What I find really interesting, like almost straight away, is that, like I said, the whole point of the study is kind of figuring out how do we understand these things when, when they're not written down anywhere. And as soon as I start talking to people about it. There's almost so much to the movement, it's hard to kind of reduce it to a single description. Is that... Is that something you'd agree with, or...?",324,78
2,18,participant,"I suppose it's, I don't know. I think what it, what, what it's doing, as you asking me these questions is is making me condense more and more, what it is that is specifically the Kong part of the movement, because the thing can exist in many, er, movement can exist in multiple kinds of situations or formations. But it's only a kong when, when it's two hands, and your feet go through the middle of the space that your two hands created. Otherwise, it's something else. So I guess in a way, it what it is, is what it is not as much as anything. So if your legs go to the side, then it's some other speed vault-y thingy. So yeah, I think for knowing what it is, is partly defined by what it's not.",529,138
2,19,interviewer,"So things kind of around that... central part of like, the two hands on the obstacle, feet coming through, can, can change and vary?",101,24
2,20,participant,"Yeah, and I think, and perhaps the reason that it's just, I mean, this is just a theory now. But perhaps the reason that it's so clearly identifiable is it's one of the vaults, which lends itself probably the vault that lends itself most cleanly to doing a precision afterwards. Because your feet are already... there's a level of control, which if you're on the side, on the side, you're not likely to land, you're going to have to correct your positioning in order to land straight. So I think maybe that's... is that an element to why? why it's kind of clear what it is. Because it is quadraped-... quadrupedal. And in, and that's why it's called a catpass, isn't it? Because that's basically how cats leap. So that's quite easily identifiable by that.",577,135
2,21,interviewer,"Mm. Are there, like, obviously, there can be a huge amount of these things either side of that, you know, taking off and landing, essentially. Are there like, perhaps more common things that you might see in takeoff and landings? Or is it just, it could be anything and it's that central part with the hands that is kind of what makes it a kong and everything else is open to change?",299,72
2,22,participant,"I think everything else is open to change. There are more common things I mean, I'd say there's a, there's a jumping element to a kong a lot of the time in the takeoff, and that can either be split leg, takeoff, but that's still, it's still a jump it's just a kind of one-two type jump, or, or like just a two footed jump. And that's if, that's if the Kong is kind of in, in motion, I suppose. Yeah, if it's, if you're running into it, um, then but yeah, and also thinking how you might say you might precision somewhere or just be standing somewhere and then kong directly from where you are, that is effectively the same thing as a two footed jump into the vault. But it's a standing jump rather than running one. So yeah, so I suppose there is something in the in the takeoff is, that then a takeoff is a jump. I don't know now I'm just talking in circles. And, yeah. In terms of landing, I think [laugh] probably always land forwards. I don't think you would do a Kong and land backwards",752,194
2,23,interviewer,[overlap] As in you land facing the same direction you were travelling in.,59,13
2,24,participant,"Yeah. I mean, it would be [laugh] I mean, I'm sure there's people that do it, because that's the thing now, like stuff that. I don't know what probably, I probably started parkour a couple of years after you. But I'd certainly when we started, there were loads of moves that just weren't familiar to me. I'd never seen anyone doing and now I'm just like, Whoa, a lot more creativity, um, that's happened. But yeah, I think I think in general, you'd, it is a forward moving move [laugh]",364,90
2,25,interviewer,"Do you, um... This might be a difficult question. to really know the answer to but is that would you say that's like your definition? Not definition. Exactly. Is that is that like a description you've just come up with based on your own practice? Or is that something you think maybe you've learned from somewhere else? Is that how you were taught the movement?",283,65
2,26,participant,"[overlap] What, the, the forward moving move?",34,7
2,27,interviewer,"I guess the kind of hands part, like the bit that you said, kind of makes it identifiably a Kong? Did anyone ever explain that to you? So this is a Kong? Was it just just kind of something you seem to have picked up, I guess?",172,47
2,28,participant,"Hmm. I think... I think it was something, I think it was something that was taught to me, because it was something that didn't come naturally to me. And this is also part of the reason that I was interested in your study is that my experiences of coaching were always that it was a move that came much more naturally to men than women. And that's not true of all parkour moves. So it's not just like, men are sportier. And, you know, that is something that I felt was noticeable. And I suspect it's got a lot to do with arms, you know, upper body strength and women tends to be less defined. So when beginners come with very little, sporting, kind of experience in that area, they you know, and most female sports as well don't, don't require you to, to put weight on your, on your arms in that way. And so I think it was taught to me, I can sort of, I can picture a time. I can picture a time when I don't know if it's when I first did it, or when I did it well, or something where I remember being like, yeah, I've got it. [laugh] And it was a, one of those, um, interestingly, a wobbly thing. But one of those wobbly children's toy things in a children's playground that's like it's on a giant spring and they sit on it and it kind of moves. But it was kind of broken and it didn't move very much. And it was quite low down. And I remember it being difficult to basically to trust, trust that my arms could take my weight, fully, and and it's something that has something to do with putting the putting your chest and your head forward first, as your hands go down, your head comes forward and I think that feels quite vulnerable. So, so yeah, I, I think I probably saw people doing the move, was aware that it was something that was a move people were doing and then asked to learn it. But also, you know, I was going to quite a lot of classes at the time and, and the terminology was getting used and as a way of describing how we were going to move in a space, you know, traverse this and then Kong over this, and then wall run this and then climb up however you want to, and, you know, those kind of things they, they seep in. But I remember, always, if I was scared, I would, what I always called Kong to the side, which isn't really a real Kong, in inverted commas, um, two hands, but my legs go to the side. And it took a significant amount of... it was a fear thing to trust.",1818,474
2,29,interviewer,Can you remember what... what was causing that fear? Or what was difficult [overlap] for that movement?,80,17
2,30,participant,"[overlap] Yeah I think, to do with, yes, throwing your body weight forwards onto your... because if you go to the side, you can, you can lift your hips kind of around rather than over, you can't really do a Kong without getting your hips high. And I remember that being something actually that some people kept saying to me, like get your hips higher, get your hips higher, which doesn't really, I never found that very helpful. Because I was like, well, I don't know how. I don't it. They don't, they're not an independent part of my body. Like, I can't sort of make them go higher. I need something a bit more helpful than that. And I remember I think Yao saying to me, think about throwing your your chest over the thing. And your hands just help you do that. And then your legs follow. And that was really helpful. And then, and then my, then my hips did get higher because my chest was trust, I guess trusting or leaning into taking my, let my, you know my hands were taking the weight in a way that... yeah.",774,193
2,31,interviewer,"Was it becoming more of a dive, maybe?",29,8
2,32,participant,"Yeah, probably. Yeah. Yeah, that is actually a [unclear] I'd forgotten the diving element. But yeah, I remember people talking about certainly that was like part of the vernacular, as well as some things being a dive kong.",174,38
2,33,interviewer,"And have you, did you find when you start to move into coaching that like the maybe some of the difficulties you had, you know, you found that was common in other people or... Like, I think you might have mentioned that it was something that you found women found harder to pick up than men.",228,56
2,34,participant,"Yeah, uh, yes, probably, I think, I think the other thing that I observed when teaching women was also the, um, there's a degree of power is required to perform the kong. And so you can't, you can't really kind of learn the Kongs slowly. I mean, you can practice jumping up onto the obstacle sort of konging up to it, but actually doing the dive part where your legs follow through and continuing, you know, continuing the flow of movement. You can't really do in slow motion. You have to, you have there's a moment of trust. And so I and I think that a lot of think women in general and this is such a this is such a generalisation. This is where I hope that I'll be anonymized. But I think women in general, in my experience, we don't, and I'm not necessarily saying that this is biological, I think it's quite possibly constructed. But we do not practice throwing our bodies around as teenagers, young, young girls in the way that many, many guys do when they say play football or they you know, I... my brothers used to put me in goal the whole time and they said I was just rubbish because I tried to always get the ball with my feet and I'd never ever dive for it. And I don't know if there is a biological element in that because we are generally potentially trying to protect the vulnerable parts of our bodies, which are, are in the centre of our bodies like they are, yeah, around our breasts, which can be really sore during puberty, or whether there's just an element where you don't throw yourself around. Because to do that would mean that you'd have to feel really confident in your body taking up space in a world, which is essentially telling you that women shouldn't take up too much space. And so there's kind of lots of lots of potential factors in there. But in general, I would say that women struggle to do that kind of diving, throwing, committing, straight off, and it takes a bit of time. And so there are multiple factors that are kind of like, at play, some of that is going to be strength stuff. But, but I think some of it is kind of having, having never really been in, in those sporting or leisure, let's say environments to enjoy that kind of throwing yourself in and not, not minding about getting injured or falling on your bum.",1763,426
2,35,interviewer,"Is it... I mean, not just for women, do you think maybe the kong is quite a scary move to do when you're starting out in general? I mean, I found it so.",111,33
2,36,participant,"Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I suppose I would say, as I'm generally naturally quite like, I don't want to go down the whole thing about like gifts and talents. But I'm from a family of sports people. And I have generally taken to sports quite well. I'd say I'm a sporty person, right. And when I came to parkour, I definitely found things... I definitely took to it. And certain things I found quite easy to say other people were struggling with. And I was like, Oh, I can fly across here. And I can do this. And you know, and I felt like, I'm quite good at this. That's my perception anyway. But I found the Kong to be something that I had to consciously overcome and learn and didn't feel that fun to learn. Because it was some it was something to, it was a challenge. So yeah, I think it is scary. Yeah, I think it is scary. And I definitely struggled - anything, I think and I think it is the diving element, you're spot on there. Because things like dive rolls as well, took me a long time to, to want to do, why would I want all of my weight in the air just catapulting towards my hands.",824,213
2,37,interviewer,"There's an element of like trusting yourself to it, trusting that you will catch yourself or will do what you need to do.",96,23
2,38,participant,"Yeah, I mean, the other biological element, actually, that I haven't mentioned is, is just the physicality, the the fact, of the fact that women carry more weight lower in their bodies. And so actually getting your hips higher is kind of an annoying command because my hips are quite heavy. So I'm going to need I need, you know, compared to, to some guys, especially guys, who've got big shoulders, they're carrying a lot more, a lot more of their weight a lot higher. So diving is easier. And your legs are not dragging you, dragging you back. And I'm sure there's there's advantages to having the weight lower down, possibly, actually quite probably things like balance, which women always get a good rep for being good at. Again, probably for a whole load of social, socially constructed reasons too. But, um, but yeah, your centre of gravity is lower.",668,151
2,39,interviewer,"Yeah, so, so that kind of getting your hips up stuff. Did you find anything like that the higher the obstacle would affect that and stuff as well?",115,28
2,40,participant,"Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I would say when I was training a lot, and I was I felt like I could legit call myself a parkour practitioner [laugh] And I was like, yeah, I'm part of this community. And I still would... yeah, I think a high kong would not be something that that I'd be particularly excited about. And I don't think I ever really got that, that comfortable with, um, Kong precisions because for me, I found it really hard to pull, pull through. So this is the other part of the Kong, I think is this, you know, it's one thing to just get over the obstacle. But then the next part is the is the pulling so that you actually make distance, which I think is maybe slight, I think it probably is quite unique to a lot of other vaults, because you can't... Well, yeah, you can't really pull with any other vaults that I can think of. Which, again, is probably why it's developed to be the one that people use when you know, if they're precisioning to something else afterwards",746,187
2,41,interviewer,Do feel that gives it a utility that other movements might not have? Because it...,64,15
2,42,participant,"I suppose I'm not really sure what utility I mean, is any of this, like... they're all just movements, right?",81,20
2,43,interviewer,"I guess, um... You know, we, there's always options for getting from A to B or whatever you're doing in parkour, is it, is there like something unique to the kong? Or is it just popular?",139,36
2,44,participant,"[overlap] I see what you mean. You know, right. Yeah, I think it also looks, it looks impressive, right? And I guess that goes hand in hand with the fact that your average Joe doesn't, if so, if you want to like vault a fence, and you're quite a sporty person, and you've never really given it much thought, you're not going to do a Kong, like you're going to do a kind of either a sort of step vault-y thing, or I don't really know what you call a step forward without a step, but a side-y...",368,100
2,45,interviewer,Just swing yourself over. Yeah.,25,5
2,46,participant,"You just swing yourself over. Yeah, you're not going to put throw your legs between, you're not going to dive over it. So, so I think there's an element to which the kong looks like something that, that an average person doesn't do. So it looks cool. And I think it's very elegant. It's, it, you are kind of there's a there's a flying element in, in the motion. And there is a moment of trust where your body flies before your hands hit. And then, and then on. So, so yeah, I think it's popular for that, but yeah, I see what you mean about the utility, it's popular also, because it has more flexibility in terms of what you can do on the other side, once you've done the vault.",513,132
2,47,interviewer,"And I think you mentioned this earlier, I made a note of it. You were talking about how it's perhaps kind of very well suited to going into a precision. Is that, you know, what, what do you think, lends itself to that? Or to that kind of thing, is it... I guess, if you're coming out the other side of a kong, you know, what, what is? What is different about it? Or is there is there anything different?",303,80
2,48,participant,"So your weight is centred, you're like, your hips are centred, they're not like on a, an angle, or skew. So when you see the place you want to precision to, like the destination as you get, you know, over, you haven't got to readjust your positioning, you just got to focus on where your feet are landing. And I think it's probably also this pulling thing, this the fact that you can pull with your hands to make that adjustment, um, for how far you go, or something. I mean, if you're... I'm just trying to think of other vaults now, I mean, it's also speed, right? Like that... A turn vault is slow, and can look nice, but it's you kind of land on the other side and you're facing the other way. You're not moving, moving on. So so there's a kind of there's a fluidity which, which was certainly really attractive when, when I started parkour that that that felt like it was always the goal, was to create fluid lines. Now that seems like there's so much more I don't really care what's parkour and what's like acrobatics, but you know like there's so much more flourishing I suppose of movement, um, but I think the Kongs endured because it's just quite impressive, it looks, it's like an acrobatic move because there's a moment of flight which when when exaggerated into you know people Kong like huge distances now they double Kong and stuff just looks like something a human wouldn't wouldn't be able to do.",1088,261
2,49,interviewer,"Mm. And it's quite, um, it's quite like a uniquely parkour movement.",51,12
2,50,participant,"Yeah, it's not it's, I don't, it's not in gymnastics it's not in... yeah, I can't, it's not part of athletics either, it's not like hurdling or long jump or any of those other things that, or high jump, it's, it's quite uniquely... I think there's something as well, uh, maybe this is because I'm old school, but something about overcoming obstacles, which the kong when executed cleanly and smoothly, feels like, here's a massive wall, and I just glided over it. And that I think that's, that's, that was the kind of... that was definitely in within the parkour culture that I was gonna say, grew up in that I did, I grew myself in. But yeah, within that parkour culture, there was definitely, it was about overcoming obstacles, whether they were mental or physical. And doing so with control, power and grace. That was the kind of goal.",635,150
2,51,interviewer,"I'm just gonna put my light on, because it's getting a bit dark. Sorry. Yeah. Okay. That's really, really interesting, really useful to... As I say, part of the, part of the study is to just talk to people about how they've kind of come to understand the Kong, just from being around parkour essentially seems to be the way that people just pick these things up. So I guess when you, when you kind of started going into coaching, you know, we've already talked a little bit about the people that maybe found it difficult or, and the reasons why. But was it something that... Actually, I guess, sorry, just to go back a second, is it like something that's important to try and learn? When you're doing parkour? Do you think? Is it something that is like an important part of parkour? Or is it just another movement?",627,150
2,52,participant,"Well, it's a good question, actually. Because I think I said, I certainly never had anyone say to me, these are the fundamentals of parkour. And once you have mastered them, you're a parkour person or anything like that. But I think there was an unwritten kind of, perhaps, yeah, perhaps a bit of a dictionary of movements that, that you... needed to be able to do or something? I don't know. So I'm thinking specifically, like, you could, you could train with anybody. And by, you know, you and me would have a very different arm jump capability, my memory of you is that you just do massive arm jumps. And I would, like, be wondering why. And, but I always felt like you seemed very confident in your upper body strength. And so that felt like you knew that you would catch yourself in that way. So we could we could train together and it would be fine that I can't do that cat leap that's too big for me. But I didn't, just try and try to put my finger on it. That wasn't a move that when I was training, a lot that I couldn't do in some other controlled environment, really, within our kind of the culture of our, of the people that I was training with, nobody was doing front flips, no one was doing corks or whatever they're called [laughs]. Um, there was a, there was a kind of what's the word I'm trying? I'm saying like, I want to say movement vocabulary, but it's more like a box of tools. They were like a box of tools. And, and... [unclear]",1105,278
2,53,interviewer,"So is it like, a kind of fundamental?",28,8
2,54,participant,"Maybe? Yeah, of sort of toolbox of proficiencies. And yeah, there'd be kind of... I certainly felt, maybe I, maybe I just internal, like, maybe I made this up. But I suspect that I internalised it from the culture was that I wasn't really doing parkour, I wasn't really a member of the gang until I had sort of mastered these fundamentals.",261,62
2,55,interviewer,"Kind of like, I really like what you said, like an unwritten [unclear], because that's the whole, the whole thesis. But somehow, that's still kind of understood, communally, that like, there's this list of, not exactly this, but there's this like, group of fundamentals, I guess, that are like, parkour techniques. And that's what people are kind of coaching, essentially.",288,60
2,56,participant,"Yeah. And I think I would, yes, you're right. And I think there will be things that I found, like, I always found palm spins, challenging. And I remember, and I used to go to Archway where there was a kind of slopey bit. And I just drilled them until I could do them. And then I could do them on any wall anywhere. And that felt really important. At the time, I remember being like, I need, I need that. Because now and I need that to be in my... in my toolbox. And there's also a thing in this about mastering something as well, where you can't just have done it a few times, you have to be able to do it wherever, as long as it's within your strength capability, the technique, you have to be able, you have to have, if that makes sense.",559,148
2,57,interviewer,"But like you say no one, no one ever just came out and said that these are the things you have to learn. It just seemed to have kind of-...",104,30
2,58,participant,"No. Yeah, and it's odd, because I remember when people started coming, well, when the Chainstore was built, and people started coming back from Gerlev, with, with loads of lache stuff. And me being like, Oh shit, I need to get good at laches now, because this is it's a new, it's a new thing on the toolbox. Before there was all the scaffolding people weren't really doing laches and maybe kind of like swing a little bit. But suddenly, laches became like a big deal, as did the thing where you know, the kind of gymnastics muscle up followed by the legs on the side swing through lark, which, which all felt like new, new tools that were needed in order to, to, I suppose it's in order to to have full range of creativity and in the changing environment, which is essentially what what happened at that time in Parkour is, more and more people were getting really fed up with us in their, in their housing estates. And we were starting to, and the movements were starting to adapt to purpose built spaces. But yeah, it was... it was, I mean, it was completely unwritten like nobody... no one ever, I think, I think I might have a book actually, that someone gave me which is like about parkour that, which I think Dan might even have written.",965,231
2,59,interviewer,[overlap] I think I had that.,21,6
2,60,participant,"It had what he called like the basics, and I'm pretty sure a Kong would have been a basic thing. But I can remember very specifically all the things which I felt were part of the toolbox, but which were harder for me to achieve like palm spins, and kong pres, so like a kong pre to a rail. I think I probably did, like 20 times in my whole life. I really avoided them. It's what just went, when, were a struggle for me and like flick ups from a rail, on a rail and things like that where they really, it's technical.",396,104
2,61,interviewer,So it's that...,9,3
2,62,participant,The fear can get in the way of developing the technique.,45,11
2,63,interviewer,"Just what you said about like Kongs to rail precisions. So that kind of thing is it... You know, it's obviously all very individual, your parkour practice. Your... so when you're doing a Kong, how do you kind of judge for yourself? Whether it's, I guess, essentially just a good Kong or a bad Kong? Like how, or when you're coaching, how do you? How do you kind of assess it as a movement? What do you what might you be looking for?",326,83
2,64,participant,"I think the fluidity of the movement. And there's an fluidity and control, which is usually measured in the, the softness of the landing. And, I mean, that was definitely a prized thing in and our, like, parkour culture, which is interesting, because it's, it's not universally, you know, that kind of incredibly quiet landings, and super control on on the balls of the feet type thing, which, which is, you know, essentially a marker of how, of how controlled you were in the movement. But there, there's like a sweet spot, I think between between con, control, and, and the fluidity of the movement and the speed. If you can combine the two, then it means that you've got power with control, I suppose. I feel like I'm, I've turned into Blane [laughs] Yeah, power, without control.",604,138
2,65,interviewer,It's almost impossible to talk about parkour techniques without saying that at least once.,75,14
2,66,participant,"Yeah, so I think I think that would determine if it was a good kong. There's something else that I thought of actually, when, just just before you asked me that question, felt significant. [pause] Let's go on, you'll probably come back something about strength that I can't remember.",221,49
2,67,interviewer,"Well, interrupt me if it pops back into your head. So I think some of the things that, you know, I guess, if you were to just look at, watch someone doing a Kong, it's tempting to start with doing just kind of assessing in terms of like, well, how far did they go? Or how fast did they do it? Do you think those kinds of things ultimately matter? Or are they just results of the controls that you were talking about before? Like, are they goals in themselves?",354,90
2,68,participant,"I don't think that I would ever look at someone doing a kong and think, oh, that was very slow, or, you know, or, and judge it in that way. And, you know, it's tempting to say, Oh, we don't judge each other's movements, in parkour. It's all about your own journey. But that's just not true. You know, there, there is a marker. There are some people that move in a certain way, which is, which is seems better. And I think it's, there's a confidence I think that perhaps, although that's not very measurable, but I've got two people doing the move in my head as I talk to you. One is somebody that I taught to kong in Bristol, actually, when I first moved here, and was kind of trying to find parkour friends. There was a girl who had been to the women's annual women's PK Gen gathering a couple of times. But she'd never had anyone to train with she just had YouTube videos. And she... yeah, she, I taught her to Kong and her Kongs were just so hesitant. And the there was, it was like, her movement, she, she had no confidence that the movement was going to execute itself well. And so that's what I've got in my head when I'm thinking of a bad kong because it was kind of slow, scrappy, and tense. Maybe there's something in there that tension, and then I've got someone like [name] and most of his movements, in general, they're just so fluid. There's, it looks quite effortless, um, and it's very precise.",1066,268
2,69,interviewer,Is there anything you- sorry-...,23,5
2,70,participant,[unclear] No go on.,13,4
2,71,interviewer,"Is there anything you can kind of put your finger on in perhaps like [name] as an example, then, that kind of conveys that? Or is it just more of a, an overall impression? I mean, even, even really granular things like, oh, he, I dunno, he hit, hits the obstacle with his hands really quietly or maintain speed or, or it just looks nice, like...?",261,66
2,72,participant,"Um, so there's no, mark, the beginning, middle, and end of the execution of the movement has a there's like, equal effort in all parts of it. So it doesn't appear to be like, I want to put that into words for you [laugh] It doesn't look like there's a huge amount of energy and effort being expended at the moment of lifting off or impact or pulling or anything like that. It all looks like one fluid movement that requires the same amount of effort. And I think that, that would be something. You mentioned the hands. Yeah, definitely. No slapping or heaviness. So it seems really light. And I think that I think there is something in this tension thing, I think, potentially, his face and his neck seem at ease in the movement. You know, those I can sort of when I think about doing a difficult kong, I can almost picture myself going like, nngh, like really tensing to try and exert a lot of, of energy and power. And that being a strain. So yeah, I think there's something about good movement, which is seemingly effortless.",799,191
2,73,interviewer,"And is that to bring it back around to coaching, is that something you would try and convey in coaching?",83,20
2,74,participant,"It's very interesting. No, I don't think so. I although I think we, we would often, so the symptom of, of something being lots of effort, or the indicator is often that it's, it is often the sound, it sounds heavy, it you know, it feels heavy, like if your hands are sore, then you're obviously slapping down in a way that's not, not so, you're listening to your body and how you're landing. So we, I think the coaching side of things would always be focusing on those, those elements, and it works back so that the quieter you're able to land, the chances are, the more controlled you're being. But, you know, I never said, hm. I dunno, I might have said in in a coaching scenario, think about this, don't worry too much about the speed of this route, but focus on being like water in the route, or some kind of image that would convey fluidity. And often, you know, with coaching, you might focus on a, on a particular thing. So we want this route to be like the most dynamic, powerful, fast thing you've ever done. Or, actually, we want it to be really clean and tight and really pay attention to details. So people, people practice those different elements and with the idea that hopefully the two things can maybe marry up. Yeah.",948,230
2,75,interviewer,"Were there any, um, I mean, it might be difficult to answer that because it's been a while but were there any like common coaching tools or coaching cues that you would use for the Kong? Would it just be a case of demonstrating it or...?",183,46
2,76,participant,"Yeah, so if someone's struggling, quite if it was a wall, probably not on a rail, it's a bit harder on a rail, but it was a wall or something, quite often break it down to Konging up to your feet, and then pushing them through. So, yeah. Do you want me to explain that better?",208,56
2,77,interviewer,"No no, I know what you mean. Yeah, like, um-",30,10
2,78,participant,"I'm not sure when you're transcribing it, whether you need to whether as long as you know what it means it's fine, or whether you need the data to actually explain what I mean.",137,34
2,79,interviewer,"No, as long as I understand it, it should be okay. I interpret it, when I analyse it.",63,18
2,80,participant,"Okay, so jumping two feet up, and then, and then the land and landing those feet, and then then jumping them off. But with your hands still on and pulling through, and then just practice and then grazing, essentially grazing your feet through until the point where you maybe don't need to lift, don't need to jump anymore. So that'd be kind of, I am fairly sure I taught a lot of, a lot of women to do that. And probably guys, too, but I think, and I don't know whether this is a gender thing as well but I don't remember any guy, any blokes needing Kong instruction, possibly because they went home and taught themselves and didn't want me to show them. Who knows, but I don't know. Anyway, moving on from that. Yes. Um, other things that I would teach people, yeah, just this thing of pushing the chest forward. Because it really, really helped me to think of, of me of throwing the chest over. And I kind of it's quite a visual thing. But the kong, it's not, it's not about getting up and over is almost about going through. I remember, I think it was Yao telling me that like, think of yourself as, as you're doing the takeoff, you're going through, not up and then down. Because when you're trying to go up, you're think and you're using your hands, you're not, your hips are going to stay down, really. Whereas if you're going through, you're kind of imagining yourself going flat, and then your hips are going to be in you know, higher up and in line to go over. The other thing that I definitely had, did a lot of coaching on was the two footed take off. I think that can be challenging for people. I don't remember learning that myself. Maybe it was something that came kind of easier to me. I don't know, but I do remember coaching that and thinking about it in this one two, way.",1374,340
2,81,interviewer,Do you mean the split foot?,21,6
2,82,participant,Yeah. What did I call it?,18,6
2,83,interviewer,You just said two foot.,18,5
2,84,participant,"Sorry. Yeah. Split foot. Yeah, cuz because initially, I think someone said to me oh, you know, you're just running and then you jump. And I was like, but that doesn't translate to most people. You don't as you're running. You don't. Otherwise that's, that's a leap. And you know, a jump off one foot is a leap. So yeah, so the idea of planting two feet, but being split is something that I remember coaching quite a lot.",316,79
2,85,interviewer,"Did you find the rhythm of it, I have really strong memories of someone trying to teach me the rhythm of that, like, yeah, 1-1-2.",98,27
2,86,participant,"Yeah, yes. Yeah, and I think I think it was one, and-two, for me in my head",53,18
2,87,interviewer,"[overlap] Yeah, something like that, yeah.",32,6
2,88,participant,"Like, so it's your last thing and then, and-two, and off you go. Yeah, no, I definitely I can feel it. Like, in my body as I'm talking about it what you do. Yeah. And that I think there was a kind of there was a bit of a st- status-y thing around that, like you wanted to be able to split foot. That was some, and maybe that's because it's slightly harder. I don't know. But also, I think it's because you can do it, because it looks smoother. So actually coming back to this thing about fluidity, it does look smoother than running, running, running, boing, on two feet, it kind of flows into, into movement. So in a hierarchy of like Kong niceness, that and then yeah, what are the other coaching points? Yeah, I think just, just being, reminding people that you're going to have to look over the, over it in a way you don't have to do when you're doing a side, step vault or something you have to lead with your with your chest and your head. Um, and trust, trust that you're gonna get, you're gonna be okay. Um, yeah, I mean, I can't, I can't remember how many people said to me like, pull pull pull. And I never really... I mean, I know I did pull a bit, otherwise I wouldn't have got as far as I did. But I never really felt like I mastered that, that feeling of a feeling like I've got enough extra pull, that's not, that different to the momentum I got from the takeoff to really go any distance.",1056,277
2,89,interviewer,"So did you feel like your, your arms, your upper body was just kind of re-orientating you, in space, kind of just to get you over the obstacle, but it wasn't really contributing to the distance you were going or anything?",173,42
2,90,participant,"Yeah, so just pulling me across the obstacle rather than anything extra, that was, um...",68,15
2,91,interviewer,"But people were kind of saying that, you know, the arms were supposed to give you extra distance?",77,18
2,92,participant,"Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that was particularly, you know, in view of doing kong precisions to a place that seemed further than I could get to. I think, you know, and a lot of those things, you, you look at a thing, and then the people that you know, you well, that are training with you, are just, I don't understand why you can't get there. Like, you should be able to, it doesn't seem that far for you, like, I know, you're strong. So I'd imagine there's, there was a technical element for me that, that I hadn't worked out in my body, how to get that extra pull.",418,110
2,93,interviewer,"So it was technique, technique over strength. It's not just brute strength gets you through.",74,15
2,94,participant,"I think there's probably an element of strength in there. But I was also quite strong. Back in the day [laugh] Yeah. Or, you know, there would be, or I would compare myself to people of a similar sort of strength to me, or, and similar physicality to me. Know, a lot of the time I in other strength areas, I'd be stronger, for example, than Kasturi,  but then she could always kong further than me. So then I would be like, well, what's what am I doing wrong? What's going on? But there's, there was never really enough understanding, I don't think within the community of, there would really be only a few basic, basic coaching commands, which are like pull more, you know. And actually, those were kind of, even though people did record stuff, people didn't film with their phones, anything like what they do now. I mean, the process of me learning to handstand and headstand, I film myself constantly, and I'm always looking at my technique, I probably would have done that, then I would probably do that now if I learnt a Kong and be looking at what was going on and be like, Oh, I see what I'm doing. I'm pulling back at that last moment, or I'm, blah, blah, blah. We didn't, I didn't do any of that stuff. I didn't film myself. I filmed things, because they were like, impressive. But I wouldn't film stuff to learn about myself in it.",1023,250
2,95,interviewer,"Yeah. It's kind of felt like it was, um. There was like a conventional wisdom, wisdom to these things that was just kind of passed on. But it wasn't, you couldn't ever really say for sure, it's 100%, true. It's just that's what worked for someone else.",189,47
2,96,participant,"Yeah. Yeah. Which is why I think, um, I think sometimes it was very useful. It's been very useful for me to be coached by people who've struggled with certain moves. And so I think, I think I was quite good Kong coach, because I had to break it down for me and work out what the fear was about. Whereas, people, I mean, I remember being coached about a kong by somebody, a male coach, who was like, just gotta commit, you know, and that wasn't very helpful. And, you know, you just got to commit doesn't really apply when it's a technique you've never done before, and you don't know what it's going to feel like, because what you're essentially saying is just throw yourself into this unknown. And when it's a move where you're leading with your head, it's, yeah, it's got to, it's gonna take a lot of commitment to really go for it, because you could seriously hurt yourself.",671,164
2,97,interviewer,Yeah.,4,1
2,98,participant,"Especially, you know, I mean, my fear with Kongs. I haven't talked about that. But my fear was always that I'd clip my foot. I'm not getting my foot high enough, clip my foot on the obstacle, and then just go, like just land on my head. Which I've never seen happen, actually, of all the thing. No, I think, have you done that?",244,64
2,99,interviewer,"I did that. I did that on my, like, third class or something. And it haunted me for a long time.",71,21
2,100,participant,"Okay, so it's possible. I mean, I wasn't there, but now I can see it. And I think...",57,18
2,101,interviewer,"Maybe I shouldn't have told you that, maybe I'm not doing you any favours by verifying this [laugh]",77,18
2,102,participant,"I know [laugh] I think a lot of the things that I'm scared of now are things that I've seen going wrong that I that that now I kind of can't unsee. But I think as well, you know, I'm getting older now. So my body doesn't quite bounce back the way that used to. Yeah. Went down into a dark hole there.",224,63
2,103,interviewer,"Yes, the inevitability of old age and decline. Yeah. I'm aware of the time, I don't want to monopolise your evening too much. That's kind of we've kind of covered pretty much all the main points that I try and aim for with these things. It's been really interesting. Is there anything that you you kind of want to add just at the end, or anything that's popped into your head, that we haven't had a chance to get to?",320,80
2,104,participant,"I don't think so. I found it really interesting. I feel kind of I feel quite fired up now to go and do some parkour, but I-",92,27
2,105,interviewer,"Oh, good.",6,2
2,106,participant,"But my wrist consultant would be like, what the hell? Why is she back so soon?",60,16
2,107,interviewer,[laugh] Blame me.,12,3
2,108,participant,"I mean, if there's any other. I mean, I've got another 10 minutes before my partner comes downstairs and demands dinner. So if you've got anything, go for it.",121,29
2,109,interviewer,"I mean, the only thing I'm kind of I've been asking people is just for yourself. Is there anything about the movement that you are curious about that you'd like to know more about? Or, you know, some of the coaching things to try and other things that you think I'd actually really like to find out if this is correct or not?",253,63
2,110,participant,Not if it's correct or not? Because I don't know if I think of movement in that way.,63,18
2,111,interviewer,"Yeah, I don't, I don't mean, I'm not trying to be like prescriptive, to movement. I mean, it's more of like, some of the coaching cues, whether they actually were useful to people.",135,33
2,112,participant,"Yeah, I mean, I'd love to hear if get your hips higher ever, ever helped anybody? Because that's what it's kind of, for me that coaching cue is always so unhelpful. Because that I suppose if I'd watched a video of myself, I probably would have been like, Oh, my hips are really low. But the mechanics of movement meant that I can't, he can't just sort of lift them up. They don't go up. Something else kind of needs to go down for them to come up. And the reason that they were down is because all the weight was, all my gravity, or, you know, my bum was heavy, and I needed to weight to be somewhere further forward. So yeah, be interesting if that ever worked for anyone, but I think mostly, and I probably am quite curious about this pulling thing. Because it's an area where I just, I just never really felt like I made a lot of progress. And I think like most of us within parkour, you know, you find the movement within the kind of broader vocabulary of the set of movements that you need to have in order to be part of the gang. And, you know, there's some which which you are naturally drawn to which your body just feels good doing. And that wasn't one that particularly felt like that for me. So I just never really trained it, which then becomes a self fulfilling thing, right? Like, you never get much better because you didn't train it. Yeah, I'd be quite interested to know what the mechanics, in a way of like when people are pulling and, and what are they... I know they're pulling with their arms, but what strength enables that because it may well be that, yeah, we're strong  at x, y, z, but I wasn't really strong in my, I don't know, pecs or traps or whatever. That is where the real dynamic part of the movement comes from so yeah, that'd be quite interesting, for me.",1374,343
2,113,interviewer,"Mm. It's, it's a shame. One of the things that I wanted to initially do with this research I haven't been able to do because of COVID, you know, the University shut down. And I can't do in person testing. But I was going to build a vaulting box with a force platform built into the top. So I could actually measure, a force platform force. So it's a platform, it's actually remarkably similar to my mouse trackpad. And it can detect the pressure and how much force people are pushing down on it with. And it's usually used for jumping and like, you know, you land on it with the feet. But I wanted to build it into a vaulting box and see what people's hands were doing. But, you know, hopefully, if this study goes well, I can then use it as justification to, to do that next one. So it's very heartening to hear someone else say that they're curious about that as well.",670,167
2,114,participant,"Yeah, I'd say yeah, I'll come and I'll come and do some Kongs for you.",50,15
2,115,interviewer,"If your wrist is okay, of course.",25,7
2,116,participant,"Yeah. No. I mean, if it's, yeah, now, I should be more careful. I do this thing. Oh, but it's really, it's gonna be really fun. It's just one day. I'm sure it'll be fine. Yeah.",121,36
2,117,interviewer,"Well, as long as you sign the form that says you're healthy.",46,12
2,118,participant,"Yeah, okay. Sure.",12,3
2,119,interviewer,"I shouldn't have put that on video. Cool. All right. Well, yeah, unless there's anything else you can think of to add, I'll stop the recording.",108,26
2,120,participant,"Yeah, I think that's it. Just know, maybe just want to say to that. I've really enjoyed thinking about it in this way. And, and yeah, it's, it's made me think about the, yeah, the level to which things were just being passed down. And how this kind of coaching culture emerged without any real sort of theory behind the coaching points. Yeah, it's kind of like, oh, we're gonna pass this thing on, but there wasn't really any. Yeah, this collective wisdom ideas really interesting, I never thought about it that way. But quite empowering, too, because I think whatever. Whatever works for you, as a, as a practitioner, could be something that you then use to coach somebody else. So there's this kind of lived experience element that feels quite valuable within the community.",605,136
2,121,interviewer,"It becomes a balancing act, because anything anecdotal like that, you can really use that to go on and coach someone else well, provided that what worked for you works for them. Yeah. But then the thing you have to avoid is people making generalisations that then they start trying to coach people and then it becomes, well, it's your fault, because the coach is not working for you rather than there's something wrong with the coaching. But that's, that's where things like national governing bodies would come in. But then we need to make sure that the national governing body is actually representing the sport. It's all, it's all very open at the moment. But, you know, one of the reasons I'm doing this study. Cool. I'll stop the recording.",588,131
3,1,interviewer,"Alright, so, as, as kind of was in the information sheet that I sent through, the study is about just kind of talking to parkour coaches about how they understand the Kong vault movement, just kind of picked that movement as a well known parkour movement. And I'm interested in in how the movement is understood, understood by coaches, given that Parkour is kind of like a decentralised sport, you know, there's not like a central organisation or rulebook or anything like that. It's just kind of grown up organically. And just seeing how how the move has kind of come to be understood without that kind of thing. So I guess the first thing I should check is, is Kong vault, a term, the term familiar to you? Or do you know the movement is something else?",597,138
3,2,participant,"Yes, it is.",7,3
3,3,interviewer,"Yeah. Is that the term you use to describe it, for classes and things? Or-",56,15
3,4,participant,"Yeah, exactly. We use Kong, uh, the vault, it's not there. Mostly, we just say Kong. Yes. Usually just Kongs.",79,20
3,5,interviewer,"Okay. You, so how would you just kind of, in your own words, just kind of describe the movement in general?",82,21
3,6,participant,"Oh, that's a good question. I never describe the movements itself without showing it before. And so yeah, I would say you have more options to do it basically. In general, the only definition of the Kong itself, it would be that your hands are both placed at the mostly at the same time, and your feet are not going sideways, but through the hands. And that's it, if you do that, double kong, if you do kong pre, if you do kong cat, it all depends. But mostly the I think the only the only specific, like stuff, the kong has is this two hands at the same time. And the feet are going through. If you if you if you do split foot, or if you jump from the same feet at the same time, I don't care. It's still kong for me, depends what you like. And yeah, that's the only one I will say.",594,158
3,7,interviewer,So you mentioned like split foot and stuff. So that's various ways to take off the movement?,73,17
3,8,participant,"Yes, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, because I mean, you can do even the Kong from you know, if you have like a stairs, you can do like one, two and then Kongs. If you have a running pre, and then dive Kongs, it's the same, it's still a Kong, different approach, I would say. And with the kid is the same, if if some kid is struggling with just jumping, you would give him a little bit easier variation. And I think split foot maybe is a little bit more complicated at the beginning to understand, which is which is really okay.",402,102
3,9,interviewer,Is that because of the kind of timing of the split foot?,44,12
3,10,participant,"Yeah exactly, it can be confusing. Because when you split the feet and you put the both hands, sometimes the knee can go into the obstacle, or your body movement is like, not on point. And it's easier to work with someone who can kong in his own way, than in explaining the most complicated way of the Kong, which is not complicated, but at the beginning, or in the lower level it can be [laugh]",307,76
3,11,interviewer,"Do you find it's like a difficult move for people to learn, in that case? Is it is it a complicated move itself?",86,23
3,12,participant,"In, er, is it in, in like normal students? Or? I mean-",37,12
3,13,interviewer,"Its kind of, I mean, it I know, it's difficult, because obviously, there's always gonna be edge cases, like individuals and yes, differences, but just kind of in general?",131,29
3,14,participant,"Yeah. I would say with the kids its a little bit harder, because their legs are growing faster than the spine, which is hard for them afterwards to get the knees closer to the body and to get through the hands. But in general, if they will find this mobility and and like this pattern to get through the hands, it they really enjoy it. It's like, yeah, it's I would say, it's one of the basics, which takes some time to learn for sure. I would also say that you should, not you should, but it may take more time than other vaults. But for sure, it's one of the fundamentals that can that you can use afterwards, as I said before, in many variations like kong pre, Kong cat and so on. So I would say yes, it's easier to learn, it's easy to learn in itself levels.",584,150
3,15,interviewer,But you can progress it to more advanced things.,39,9
3,16,participant,"Yeah, exactly. Like, like the pre, you can do a pre basically, from when you was born, let's say but on some higher levels or on the rails, it takes a little bit more time. Its like piano, etc, yes.",147,40
3,17,interviewer,"You mentioned, you know, it being one of the basics or fundamental. Do you think it's quite an important parkour move to learn when they come to the sport?",122,29
3,18,participant,"Yeah, I mean, it's, it's hard for me to say what's important for parkour. But I'm, I would say, it's, it's if you are, like training for some time, I would say, if you didn't learn it for now, I would ask what did you learn, then? Because it's one of the really first move you should consider. It's basically like, running forward, but using with hands, or like, it's, I don't know, if you didn't learn it. Yeah, after like one year of training, I would be really asking myself where your focus was, or focus on training was? Because it's, yeah, it's, I would be surprised if someone wouldn't know it after a few times.",459,117
3,19,interviewer,"I guess, um, maybe the word important wasn't the best word to use. But like, is it, is it a really useful move for people to learn? Is it something that's really, you know, I guess, you used the word fundamental, like, it's a really useful movement? That is worth learning?",207,51
3,20,participant,"Yeah, I would say, yeah, it's definitely worth learning. For sure. For sure, sure. Because it gives you some understanding how this this two hands works. If you don't learn it, at that point, you can struggle than the other levels. But if you don't want to learn for sure, for sure why not. There are more effective ways how to approach obstacles. But I would say it's the most powerful one with the distance, I guess, except of the running pre [unclear]",350,83
3,21,interviewer,"So, I mean, when you say there are other more effective ways to approach the obstacle, do you mean in terms of like, faster to go over it or...?",108,29
3,22,participant,"Yes, go faster or less energetic, erm, important, like, you know, you can just go around. [unclear]",74,17
3,23,interviewer,"So what, what would make you choose to do a Kong vault then? If some other movements might be more effective, but what does it give you? That those other movements might not?",137,33
3,24,participant,"My decision, that's all, mostly. But yeah, but yeah, if you want to do kong to cat leap, and I will choose a dash to cat leap, dash is way different. For sure. Because it needs my energy, way higher than the Kongs. If I want to do a step vault to cat leap, it takes more energy in just one hand, and it's a bit more harder, I would say. And it, the kong, yeah, that now I realise the Kong is one in which I'm really focused on, like, I'm not really going sideways, or like in speed or speed, step or step or whatever. The Kong is really straight, which makes me really see what's happening right now. And it's not making my body to go in one or the other way. So I think that's a big benefit of it. Even the dash is the same that you see are still our lean backwards, which is, which can be a little bit confusing for a while.",620,170
3,25,interviewer,"So like that combination of being really straight, so you don't have to kind of bring yourself back to that after you've gone over the obstacle, is useful?",123,28
3,26,participant,"Exactly, yeah. I would say it's very, very useful and pretty natural. I would say it looks like a cat move. I think even I think you in UK, they use catpass or something like that.",137,36
3,27,interviewer,"Yeah, some some people do it. People alternate. Yeah.",41,9
3,28,participant,"Yeah, I know the term but we don't use it. We just say kong.",43,14
3,29,interviewer,"So you know, we we mentioned a little bit about takeoff and there's a couple different ways you can do it. Is it similar for the landing? Like you can come out of it and land or do whatever, a whole bunch of other ways?",169,45
3,30,participant,"You can even fail the landing [laugh] For sure, yeah, you can do the pre so the legs are straight. You can do the split so you want to run fast, just like, pah, and run away. Yeah, for sure. And the same is applying with as intake of your body timing and position has to be also adapted in landing, if you want to run fast, you should be lean forward to get ready to run super fast. If you want to get the stick as good as possible, you should be leaned a little back so the power which is incoming to the landing is just kind of pushed you into the landing not over the landing. And you can do another like, like Kong to step vault, so you need to be already Kong and lean sideways. Which which the Kong allows you as well, you, you can go straight, but you can still go a little bit sideways. So it's very effective. And with the landing yeah, you have so many possibilities you can land to lache as well you can do whatever, cat leap, it's very, very easy to to change your directions. You saw people do kong fronts, Kong gainers, Kong, whatever, I don't know. You know, it's, it's, you have some limited stuff to do with it. But I would say with this, you can really play.",898,234
3,31,interviewer,"Do you, do you think that kind of makes it stand out from some of the other vaults? And that gives you all these options? Or do you think that's just people could do that with anything?",144,37
3,32,participant,"Yeah, it can be that it's it has so many like, like, it's not just the Kong, but the the specification with the two hands you mostly see in a lot of other movements. I would say it's more hyped that you that when you say for example, parkour, someone would already saw this one in comparison to other one, because it's very easy to remember. And it looks powerful. And yeah, it's you can make it as I said many ways, so it's easier to learn or easy to remember. And but for me, personally, I don't I don't level the vaults itself. For me, it's just another vault, just another approach how to use it, but it's maybe a little bit more effective. But it has some how it's called not benefits. But the other other way. Cons.",548,140
3,33,interviewer,"Yeah? What would be the, what would be the cons?",36,10
3,34,participant,"Yeah, that itself that you need so much energy, you don't mostly but even if you want to use it as as useful as possible, for example, like I am, I don't want to say drunk, but I want to use the smallest percentage of my energy as possible. I wouldn't choose the kong, it would be like on the on the far, far back mostly. And also, with the Kong, it's a little bit problem if you're one or the other hand is injured, or the wrist or if this happens, you are pretty much limited, which is in other vaults, except of I think dash, it's not a problem with step vault you can just go the other side, with  speed you can go the other side. So so so you need to be kind of fit for it. Yes.",514,142
3,35,interviewer,Yeah I can see that.,15,5
3,36,participant,"Yes. And sometimes your hands can struggle the most I would say because it's so powerful if the the placement of your hands are on something which is like rough, like stone small stones or something, it can really easily destroy your hands and I don't know if how much you've pushed into it, but after a few strong or powerful tries, your hands are getting red and maybe swollen, I dunno. And it hurts sometimes.",326,76
3,37,interviewer,"It's um, I mean, just because you mentioned push when you're going on to the obstacle, are the arms kind of pushing you off it as well or are they just kind of touching it as you go over?",143,39
3,38,participant,"It really depends. I would say, it's pushing when I want to go far or up it's pulling when I want to go far or mostly down like for the.. yeah, it's very different and it just taps when I want to go get over so my ass is higher than my torso. Yeah, also different. The rail is way different story. Right. The rail is like, you know, like there is this thing if you go thumb down, thumb up, I always go thumb down. I'm like, all security.",327,90
3,39,interviewer,"Yeah. Is that, um, with the rail just because you can't get the hand flat? You can't do the same push?",75,21
3,40,participant,You can but it's so risky.,19,6
3,41,interviewer,Right [laugh],10,2
3,42,participant,"You know, even if it's a flat rail, I would rather go like this. Because it's like, wow, I'm scared. Yeah.",76,21
3,43,interviewer,Quite small target to throw yourself at.,33,7
3,44,participant,"Yeah, exactly. And it's so all so fast it's happening. So I will have my small thumbs to to get security done.",83,22
3,45,interviewer,Do you find that it's like a scary move in general? Or perhaps when people are learning it?,71,18
3,46,participant,"In the beginning, you mean?",21,5
3,47,interviewer,"Yeah, just, maybe scary is a bit of a strong word. But is it, is it more so than the other vaults?",72,22
3,48,participant,"I know if they like, take more time to go for it?",36,12
3,49,interviewer,"Yeah, I mean, or is it just like, people are a bit more cautious about it or intimidated? Or do you find that people are just fine with it?",106,29
3,50,participant,In comparison to other vaults?,25,5
3,51,interviewer,Yeah.,4,1
3,52,participant,"I, I really don't know. To be fair. I, well, I didn't notice any like struggle, because mostly when we, when we teach it, we show them first how to get the hands on the obstacle and the feet on the obstacle. And from this point, we tell them yeah, we go on, we'll go on, we go on with, with other steps and so on. And, and then we show show them even sometimes before to do Kong on the ground, because if you can go like, like there is a line and you put feet, hands here and you can land here with feet, you are very fine with the Kong afterwards, because it teaches you, teaches you how to push and get over the point where your hands are placed. And after this point, when we showed the kids or the practitioners, this pattern, they are mostly okay. Like, you can always go a little bit sideways, we call it I think two hander, two hands. Like you put the two hands and the feet go around. Which is not the best approach. But it gives this mental block maybe a way for a while. Yeah, if they struggle too much, just, just do it. It's you still have to push you there is but do it time to time otherwise, you will not have this balance or something.",876,232
3,53,interviewer,"Oh, switching sides?",16,3
3,54,participant,"Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Like with a speed. If you do speed or stuff too much on one side, it takes some, how's it called, it takes some some part of you, takes a price.",125,34
3,55,interviewer,"So if you if you kind of break it down when you're coaching it quite well, quite a lot. It it doesn't end up being all that scary? Because people have got used to the movement before they have to do it on something.",166,44
3,56,participant,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, they just go. They don't just go to the Kong like, okay, like, we will learn how to kong here. This is how you do it. Now do it. No, no, no, you can with some really, with the kids, they are really good in watching. So some, some of them can really repeat what you just did, which is amazing. But that's really a small, small part of it. And mostly, it's not how we do it, because they there is there is too much detail you should focus on. And yeah, and it's, as I said, if we, if we learn, if we teach it, the kids on the wooden obstacle, there is also risk and we don't want the kids to get hurt and so on. And so with the knees mostly, you know, like when you get the knees to your chest, it can hit the edge and it's it's, the things can go wrong.",565,162
3,57,interviewer,"You mentioned earlier on that, you know, it's a movement that people kind of recognise outside of parkour as well.",91,20
3,58,participant,I would say yes.,12,4
3,59,interviewer,Do you think it's kind of quite like a almost a famous movement now by this point?,64,17
3,60,participant,Oh now? I'm not sure if now. I don't know what's famous now to be fair.,50,16
3,61,interviewer,"I mean, I guess I'd say like, is it something that, yeah, like you say people outside of parkour will recognise it, as parkour.",97,24
3,62,participant,"I will say yes. Because when you do commercials and when you do something like this, you want to see this Kong where where your body is not how you see it on the street, and the Kong is perfect, have it your feet are flying and your hands are like crazy stuff debacle. Even I think like [name] did like this double Kong over some cars. And many people saw it when you like, you know, like when you see some Red Bull athletes, and they want to do something which people are amazed from you just do Kong, the step vault they can do as well because, you know, it's more simple. The dash is too complicated. And it's not that powerful. It's maybe with something connected. The parkour is, parkour, I don't know, it's like, like some sport, which is not like violent, but which which has some power in it. Like to, but but to be to be clear the power of individual, both mentally and physically. Just shown in the movement, like you have so much control and so much power in the movement that when you look at it, you're like, wow, okay. Like, this guy now knows what to do.",822,207
3,63,interviewer,"It's, it's impressive when you see it.",28,7
3,64,participant,"Exactly, yeah. Impressive.",21,3
3,65,interviewer,"Do you find that people like using the movement, because it looks impressive sometimes? Is it something that people want to put in videos and things?",121,26
3,66,participant,"This, I don't know. I mean, when you look at if I would use term freerunner, they use Kong sometimes, as well as the parkour practitioners. But, um, just because it looks good, I wouldn't say it, because the Kong itself, it looks good, just from some angles. And in some, this aspect, like when you do kong pre, it looks great. But the kong itself if you do it, it just like okay, Kong, and if you do the video of yourself doing the parkour video, mostly seen by parkour athletes, and they know the Kong is not that difficult to learn, so they want to see some more. So I would say the Kong itself, you don't use because the Kong itself looks nice, but because you want to add something to the kong or after the kong.",548,140
3,67,interviewer,Right. Mm. I see what you mean.,22,7
3,68,participant,"As I said before it, you have so many options with it. So it's maybe easier to do the Kong than something else.",85,23
3,69,interviewer,"Mm. So you can, the movement itself might not be that impressive, but you can put it in some really impressive situations.",97,22
3,70,participant,"Exactly. Yeah. Exactly. If it's the height, you know, like what [name] did, this Kong over the rail itself on the ground wouldn't be anything would be like, Oh, it's Kong on the ground. But because it's a drop, you are like, Oh, fuck, and it's a it's a rail and he slipped, you're like, Oh, Jesus Christ.",221,58
3,71,interviewer,"And so I'm curious for yourself, where did you kind of learn the movement? Did you just like, teach yourself? Did you just experiment? Or were you taught by someone, you go to classes or anything like that?",161,38
3,72,participant,"I taught myself. To be to be fair, we, I started like, in 2009, with my friends for one week than I had done. I didn't do it for four week-, for four more years. And then I saw the gym and I wanted to learn backflip, that's pretty much my backstory in a nutshell. But the first thing what, which I learned was the Kong actually, because it was very hyped in 2009. And so it was like something you always saw on the, the silhouette pictures of, you know, like, this, this guy flying. And so it was one of the first moves I learned. And then I learned the Kong to roll, like, you know, like you tap and the roll, because it's basically a dive roll. But it's easy. And again, impressive. Like, you're, it's nice thing.",537,141
3,73,interviewer,So did you did you just kind of see it in a video and try it? Or did you follow a tutorial or anything like that?,86,26
3,74,participant,"No, I just saw it in the video. But when I wanted to, I already knew it, I already know how to do double Kong and so on. But afterwards, I watched like instruction videos or more with the speed step, and how to get the shoulders down from other athletes. Even though I did it myself time to time. I wanted to see the pros of other athletes to get maybe some some point I'm missing or something. Because I was struggling with the distance a lot. Like I was like, Why can't I do this kong pre? The other kids, other guys can do it and I can't. So what, what am I missing? And I wanted to find out so I was watching some tutorial videos and so on. And so.",497,134
3,75,interviewer,Did you figure out what what was missing?,33,8
3,76,participant,"Yeah, the time that I put in, the practice, I would say.",41,12
3,77,interviewer,"Oh really, so just a case of, just do more of it. And you'll get it.",48,16
3,78,participant,"Yeah, at that point. I was like again 14 so my torso was shorter than my legs and so I was struggling as well, I was like, I was not doing this technique, you know, like, where you use the thumb, but I really had to push with my finger. And, and in general, I wasn't that powerful. It's all, you know, even though the kids when I see, you know, when I say kids, I mean, like, when I saw this be this new Storror in the UK, what their names? Motus Project I think?",344,96
3,79,interviewer,"Ah yeah, yeah. Yeah.",14,4
3,80,participant,"Yeah, they're like they were like young. And they could do big kongs, yeah, they were light and they were flying all around and I wasn't this kind of the kid, I was, I wasn't a fat kid or something I was just not powerful at all.",173,47
3,81,interviewer,"So as you as, you've kind of continued practising and moved into coaching, have you had to, like, update your kind of understanding of the movement? Or if you've been able to just kind of coach it the same way you learned it? Or?",177,44
3,82,participant,"Definitely no, I wouldn't coach it as I learned it. I would say at the beginning, I started to coach with someone next to me with the guy who already coached. But in general, I have always been because when you're in community, and so on, you want to kind of like, teach each other, always something. So you have some approach of explaining it to other persons, if, even though mostly are in the community, they're not always on the same level, but they understand the way how we explain this stuff. So the most, the hardest way was not, was to adapt to this younger generation level, like, you know, like in very small kids. But it wasn't that hard. It was just like, the most complicated, which wasn't, so it was really fine for me to switch to coaching. And, yeah, I just after time, I get more comfortable with what the kids can do. Because at the beginning, I was really trying to spot them all the time. And, but at the time, I was like, okay, they, they don't need that much spotting, they need spotting, but it's also for you very exhausting. Even though it's good that you spot the kid. I don't say you shouldn't spot the kid. But, but not all the time. Yeah, I was spotting them all the time. And it makes them maybe even for them, maybe it makes them too comfortable that someone is next to them. So you need to time to time, give them a little bit distance, like now it's a danger zone.",1069,268
3,83,interviewer,"And so do you with kind of coaching organisations that you're with now? Do you guys talk about how you teach movements to kids? Or is it kind of down to the individual coach, or...?",139,35
3,84,participant,"Yeah, we, we, we had some meetings about how it's called, like the teaching programme basically forgot the name, like you have some period of time where you kind of train different levels. And then you have a break and then again, [unclear], we call it. I don't know the term in English. But and we also teach how to spot the kids with different different, like techniques. And so, you know, like backflip you, you support the pelvis and flip him over with the Kong view mostly on the sides, which prefers to you because that's what I said it's going straight forward. And you should focus on the arm and on the shoulder because that's where his head is very close to so when he's falling forward, you can like, you know, at least push him on the back, or like go with him. And yeah, we had like some time to talk with other coaches how we approach spotting, but mostly everyone has some idea of how to spot, sort of thing. And we mostly teach it on the soft mattresses so if you fall it's okay. You're not really crazy jackasses.",798,195
3,85,interviewer,"And beyond even spotting are there like things that you are looking for in the Kong where you can kind of watch it and go, yeah, that was a good one, that was a bad one or anything like that. What what are you kind of looking forward to say this is this is a good movement or a bad movement?",226,61
3,86,participant,"Yeah. At the point where the only thing which I'm looking at, at the beginning at the beginning, is if they use the thumb or not that the fundament for me to understand the first to not use the thumb, to get the full flat hand. Even though it never happened to me that the kid dislocated the thumb or something like that. But I would say that I'm very strict with full hand on the on the, on the obstacle. And afterwards I don't... I would say the landing afterwards. And the rest is, for me irrelevant. If the landing is like, you know, like, very good, like, on point. Not it doesn't need to be, you know, like, on the toes. And so, but if I see that he has the power to control the drop, it's okay. If he, if he lands on the heel, or she it's, it's bad. Yeah, yeah, that's it. That's it. The rest? If it's done correctly, you go straight through the hands. It's for me, okay, Kong, it's like a kong, it's a Kong.",677,183
3,87,interviewer,"So as long as they don't, you know, come out, come out of it and just fall flat on their face. Yeah, they have control and they're upright and stuff.",112,30
3,88,participant,"Exactly, exactly. I mean, it's hard for me to explain what do I see in a good Kong, because, you know, it's like, if you are angled for for for time, for me, I already see it's not the best Kong, but I wouldn't say it's bad Kong, it's a Kong, you you did it in the way you did it. But after what I focus on is really the the takeoff, it can be whatever, but the execution of the Kong, which is really just the hands on the ground and going through the hands, hands on, on a, you know, flat flat hands, going through the, through the hands with feet, and then landing correctly with control that, Oh, I'm focusing on that, because the rest is really allowed. You can have a head up, you know, you can do whatever, but just just do it with control.",559,150
3,89,interviewer,"If, if you had someone who could do could do that well, are there's other things you might get them to do to try and like progress them that you would try and challenge them with the Kong vault. Like, try and go further or try and go faster?",187,49
3,90,participant,"Yeah, after after time, for sure. But it depends, because if someone if we just started lesson and someone gets it very fast, I would give him extra rounds to really get it into his head. But yeah, after I will just throw the, but individual, not everyone but individual and say, okay, you can do like now a little bit more speed. Or you can try to take off more further or land a little bit more far as far as you can, even though if he lands on the heels, but he goes the distance. I'm like, okay, you try to work, because if you go the distance, you're really lean backward. So I mean, the heels are necessary, sometimes. So it's okay for me. Yeah. But of course, I will not push him into the massive Kong where he fell on the back end. So yeah, but yeah, the progression is specially important. Also, if you can play with it, like, sometimes if the kid is really good at it, and he's comfortable with the movement, we give him a movement before or afterwards. So he can connect it, which is another aspect. The kids are struggling with the flow. But that's that's another topic I would say.",838,211
3,91,interviewer,"It's um, is the Kong vault good for that kind of flow to connect to other movements? Or is it harder to connect with movements?",99,25
3,92,participant,"If you can control it? For sure. Yes. But at the beginning level, I wouldn't say so. Because if you land and you cannot jump straight, like plyometrics you cannot jump straight into the Kong, it looks sketchy. It looks very sketchy. And for the kids, they sometimes have to get into the straight line which is maybe also another disadvantage of the kong because you should be straight on the obstacle. Not straight on the obstacle but you want to get your body from the some angle to get the posture right. And yeah, that's what that was. I now realise we teach also the Kong a little bit sideways sometime. Like the obstacle is not like this. Like this, like going sideways because it's also kind of kong.",556,130
3,93,interviewer,"So you know, you know always at like a perfect 90 degrees to the obstacle.",58,15
3,94,participant,"Exactly. Yeah, you can go whatever degree which is, which is actually easier to learn this way because you're, you can push and your feet can go little bit behind you and sideways, which is [unclear]",156,36
3,95,interviewer,"But as long as it's still that, like, two hands-",35,10
3,96,participant,Exactly.,7,1
3,97,interviewer,-feet together pattern.,19,3
3,98,participant,"Yeah, yeah, two hands, but now they can be like, you know, like a bit adapted.",57,16
3,99,interviewer,"It's, it's really curious because it's one of the things I'm kind of looking at with the study is how there's all these variations but people still know, it's a kong, you know?",134,33
3,100,participant,Yeah. Um.,6,2
3,101,interviewer,I just find that really interesting.,30,6
3,102,participant,"I don't care, to be fair. How you call it, you can call it for me, you can call it even step vault I will be like, okay, right. I don't care. Okay. But mostly, mostly, you see, there's a Kong because there is nothing else to call it when you go like two hands and push even sideways. Or if you don't, that's why it does a kong. And mostly there, it's recognised as a kong.",273,77
3,103,interviewer,"Yeah. Yeah, I find that really interesting. It's like, you know it when you see it, but you can't always necessarily say why.",95,23
3,104,participant,"Yeah. Yeah, I will say if there is someone telling me it's not a Kong, it's a two hander. I will be like, okay, you keep it, I will keep mine I don't care. You know, like in France, if I would, I'm not sure enough to be fair, but in when I was in Serbia, they're using the French word like, saut de bra, saut de chat and so on. I was so confused. I was like, do saut de chat. I don't know what's that! And then I was like, Okay, well, I will try my best, but you have to go first. And then he did it. And I was like, okay, so that means a kong pre or something like that. Or as I said, catpass. If catpass if, if I didn't see the video where they use the term over and over again, I would be like, do a catpass. I was like, What? What, what cat?",537,162
3,105,interviewer,"Yeah, I guess it's it's not so much about the actual, like individual labels. It's just like, a useful way to, like a shorthand way to kind of describe to someone like oh, that's that's the move you could try there.",163,41
3,106,participant,"Yeah, exactly. It's like language. Yeah, you say? I say meco. So you say meat. You know, it's a language. It's a language. It can be different, in America, I don't know what they say. I think this is the same with a step vault and the speed step. What what, you know what, what it's like, with the speed step, I see the speed in the word, and you have to go fast. And but it's still one feet in one hand and the other feet is very true. So and we had a big discussion about it in our community, and I was like, Yeah, I don't know. Just use the one and I know what you mean.",421,120
3,107,interviewer,"Yeah. I suppose most of the time, if some if, for whatever reason, like you say you're like, wait, I don't I'm not sure what you mean. Yeah, you can just show it to people. Right?",131,36
3,108,participant,"Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Because that's what's nice about parkour, you can go to China, you to people who are training, the parkour but they are totally not speaking English or some of your language. And you can just train together. That's the thing, like, like, you can point or you can just do the pre as well, even though it's yeah, it's weird, because there is a basically a silent guy. But yeah you, the movement itself, it's, I would say, as you say, at the beginning, the parkour itself isn't one organisation, but the most of the patterns are still there, like, you know, like English, German, and the languages are still the indo-European. And so I would say we are very the end, the Parkour is very young sport. So this would be old English and all the old Norse or old Germany. So it's still very young. And so the so the names are pretty much the same.",661,162
3,109,interviewer,"So kind of coming back to coaching a little bit. You know, you mentioned you that you guys talk about teaching skills and just kind of share knowledge, I guess, with each other, about how to coach these things. Would it do you think it would be useful to have something that's like, a general resource for coaches to look to for like, this is a good way to coach the Kong vault or even just, you know, some safety tips, things like that? ",341,84
3,110,participant,"Oh, uh. You mean like a source where they look at how to teach it?",49,15
3,111,interviewer,"Yeah, I mean, just kind of, like I said, At the start, you know, there's no central rulebook or anything for parkour. Yeah, and that's good, you know? Yeah. But when it comes to coaching, you know, we need to make sure that people are being taught safely and effectively.",206,50
3,112,participant,Yeah.,4,1
3,113,interviewer,"I'm curious how those two things kind of match up in your mind whether, whether we should have some more of that stuff or whether, you know, it's against some kind of against parkour to do that kind of thing?",163,40
3,114,participant,"Okay. Yeah, I see. I mean, there are already books, not how to teach parkour. But for example, I think Max Henry had it. His, his book where he describes the movement. But, and there was even from Parkour One, or at Etre Fort one book with even illustrations of a jumps, it's very old, even the landing was like, not on point for me, but it was still a good landing. And I mean, from the book, what can you learn from the book, just theory, mostly, mostly, something which you can try to apply, but the best way I will say is to, maybe there are many tutorials on YouTube. So the best way would be, I think, for me, with this fundamental to, to do it yourself, at least to learn it, somehow. And maybe to get a partner who you can try to spot at. And maybe to have a little bit fun, like, Okay, I will do now something you will not expect and try to save me, you know, this, this, you know, fire trying, like you do a double Kong on one obstacle, and you want him to save you. And it really gives him some reflexes and maybe some idea what he should be checking. And as I said before, for example, I learned my technique in Serbia, how to spot for a kong, because they did on the camp instruction, like seminar workshop, how to, like, teach some fundamental movement, and mostly with this with vaults, like kong, speedstep, whatever the best is to get one hand, which is touching the obstacle, like, where your forearms and the shoulder, because that's very easy to manipulate the person with. You don't really like grab him, you're just like with him. If he's fine, you just let him go. If it's not fine, you will grab it.",1235,314
3,115,interviewer,"So kind of, um, yeah, experimentation and social, sharing, I guess, kind of knowledge and experiment playing and-",89,18
3,116,participant,"Yeah, but but you would figure out it yourself. I mean, if you would try to spot someone doing Kong to grab his, not ass but like, you know, like, lower back. You wouldn't catch him? Because it's no fun. But but but you will find out okay, what, what gives me some time to get with him? It's the hand because it's like for a while on the on the obstacle. If he's doing a double Kong, of course, you have no idea? No way. You kind of have to find it yourself.",341,94
3,117,interviewer,"So we've got through a lot of the kinds of questions I like to try and get through to with people. I guess. Is there anything about the Kong vault movement that you would like to know more about or that you're curious about? You feel like maybe you don't know, for yourself?",214,53
3,118,participant,What do you mean? Like-,17,5
3,119,interviewer,"I'm just, I'm just kind of asking people if if there's anything, anything that they like, you know, I'd like to know more about this. Or maybe I'm not sure if this is working or effective, or... I mean, it's fine if the answer's no, as well [laugh]",181,48
3,120,participant,"Yeah I'm just very confused... because, hmm. With, with, Kong if if, if I have some questions, about kong. Uh. Well, I have to think for a while.",104,28
3,121,interviewer,That's okay.,9,2
3,122,participant,"For me, no, but in general. Huh.",22,7
3,123,interviewer,"Don't worry if the answer is no, it's, it's fine.",34,10
3,124,participant,"If it will be like straight instinct, answer it would be no, but but I'm trying to pull out some question which is maybe forced but Okay, I will go with no.",120,32
3,125,interviewer,"Yeah, no, that's fine. That's absolutely fine. It's just because I'm kind of investigating this, investigate, makes it sound very serious. But because I'm talking to people about this stuff, you know, it's just seeing what what people might be curious about really? Yeah, [unclear]",218,45
3,126,participant,"Oh wait, the people or me? Like other people or, I would be curious about it.",58,16
3,127,interviewer,"Yeah, you.",7,2
3,128,participant,"Ah okay, I'll say no, no.",16,6
3,129,interviewer,"Okay, cool. Is there just kind of anything else that thats popped into your head or you thought of while we're doing this that you thought might be good to mention that didn't get a chance to or didn't come up? Anything else you want to add or throw in there?",202,51
3,130,participant,"I don't know. Just when it's mostly for like, coach, coach, coaching people to coaching people, right? It is a question if this if this stuff is for, from coaches to coaches?",133,32
3,131,interviewer,"Yeah, kind of. So it's, the whole study is just kind of about you know, how we've kind of come to understand these movements-",95,24
3,132,participant,"Yeah, yeah.",8,2
3,133,interviewer,-organically.,11,1
3,134,participant,"You're, but mostly like, asking the other coaches.",39,8
3,135,interviewer,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm talking to coaches.",28,7
3,136,participant,"Yeah, and the result will be mostly public, then the mostly coaches will see it, right.",68,16
3,137,interviewer,"Yeah, I mean, I hope to make it open. Just open access. Okay. So anyone could read it. But yeah, I mean, it might be more useful for coaches. And maybe, I don't know, but the idea is to just make it generally open access.",164,45
3,138,participant,"Okay, yeah, that's fine. I dunno, with with coaching itself, I would just say try to enjoy as much as possible. I found out that I enjoyed it the first years. And after a while, it took a lot of time, which I did not want it. It was it's very time consuming. Even though I enjoy the kids, the kids were great. Even the grown ups were great, and so on. But it's very unique to get like the social boundness, which I am not the best at. I'm very, I would say I'm personally a little bit more introvert than extrovert and the, um, just be strict with the safety. But with the fun on the training, I will be more open. If the kids seems like or the practitioner seems like they don't enjoy it. Yeah. Just skip on. Move on. That's for me. Do you actually coach?",570,151
3,139,interviewer,"I did, I haven't done for a couple years because I went to university, um, as an adult. But yeah, I used to coach with Parkour Generations in London.",114,29
3,140,participant,"Oh right, nice.",11,3
3,141,interviewer,From 2012 to about 2017. So about five years or so.,39,11
3,142,participant,"Five years. Yeah. That's a lot. Yeah. That's a great experience. Yeah, nice.",55,13
3,143,interviewer,"Well, it doesn't feel like it sometimes. But when you say like, Oh, yeah, five years you go well yeah, that's quite a long time. Yeah, it's, it's good. I do miss it a little bit. But, you know, I'm doing doing this instead at the moment, which is nice.",183,50
3,144,participant,"Yes. I mean, but basically, I would say everyone, it's maybe cliche in a movement area, like everyone is a practitioner, and also a student and the teacher, you know, even the kids between themselves they are teachers. I would say the role of a teacher is something else than a teaching actually, to be fair, I don't know how you see it. After the five years, I'm just teaching for three years, I would say, two, three years, I don't even know with some breaks, like now the corona, but I would say the teacher should be more like a part of the group than a teacher, as you see a teacher the word like in school, you know, you know, like, because it, I mean, I like person who explained the stuff, but not just because he's a teacher. If the kid is explaining, sometimes I give the people the opportunity to explain the movement, because they are just getting through the movement. He understood it, and now he has it in head, I have my experience time back, you know, like seven years of practising this fucking movement. And now I'm telling you, you know, it's like talking with some PhD, and you're just like, kindergarten kid, you know, the best way how to teach is the same level to push you kind of slowly. And the teacher should be there to just get this, you know, like with interviews, there is like opposition scan, you know, like the people who are talking and you are just there to, to put them in the right way. Pretty much. Yeah, that's my point of view.",1130,277
3,145,interviewer,"No, I like it. So one of the things that I found talking to people as well, is that you do have to kind of focus on the individual.",99,29
3,146,participant,Yeah.,4,1
3,147,interviewer,"You can, you can coach for like general ideas, because they're probably going to help the most amount of people. But you, you can't ignore the individual and so you have to coach to them. So yeah, like you say, some people are going to are going to want that PhD level. Yeah, they're gonna want that straightaway. They're like yeah, give that, give me, give it to me, and some people are going to need you to just be there going, Okay, one hand, two hand and like going really slow.",369,92
3,148,participant,Yeah. Exactly.,11,2
3,149,interviewer,-Just have to adapt to that.,21,6
3,150,participant,"That's right. That's right. And yeah, that I don't know how you did that. We sometimes separate them into the parts, which are like a little bit better and worse, which is not the best for the group.",152,38
3,151,interviewer,"I think it's okay for some stuff, you know, if yeah, when it comes to safety, you know, sometimes you have to do that, just to make sure that people are being challenged appropriately. But it shouldn't be like the only thing you do. It's good to mix the crowd as well. Like you say, yeah, now-",222,57
3,152,participant,"We, it's different approaches. Or I would say yeah. All over around the world, they will tell you for sure. Something similar, but for sure. Something different. I wonder I'm looking forward for the research.",163,35
3,153,interviewer,"Okay, I'm gonna I'm gonna stop recording, because I think you know, we're kind of towards the end. So let me just...",85,22
4,1,interviewer,"There we go. So thank you for, for coming along today. I really appreciate it. You read the information sheet that I sent over, the thing that you signed. Was there any, any questions about anything in there that you weren't sure about? Or anything you want to ask?",207,49
4,2,participant,No.,2,1
4,3,interviewer,"Okay. So I guess the good place to start is just to kind of explain a little bit about what I'm hoping to achieve. I'm basically trying to just talk to a bunch of parkour coaches, about some of the movements that we do in parkour, some of the techniques, particularly the ones that kind of, you know, we've given names and, and perhaps could be identified as like, parkour, specific techniques, and how people kind of understand those things. Bearing in mind that, you know, it's kind of a decentralised sport. At the moment, there's not like a central rulebook or guideline or anything. Although, you know, things might be moving that way with governing bodies and whatnot. And just kind of how it's how that stuff kind of come about, quite organically. And I picked the Kong vault, just because it's quite a well known parkour movement. But I guess the first thing I should check with you is, is that a terminology that's familiar to you, kong vault?",747,171
4,4,participant,"Oh yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm surprised that you're using kong vault, I would have expected catpass based on your accent.",90,20
4,5,interviewer,"Oh really, is it? Do you know if one is used more than the other in certain areas?",62,18
4,6,participant,"Yes, kong vault. So my understanding is that a lot of the UK scene as well as Australia uses catpass. Whereas in the United States is almost all Kong vault.",123,30
4,7,interviewer,Okay. I don't suppose you know why- go on.,30,9
4,8,participant,"So the terminology was originally Kong vault was invented by a group called Urban Freeflow. So they originally called the vaults, a monkey vault. And then I think it was Blue who did a really giant one, and they're like, that's not a monkey, that's bloody King kong. So then for a while, people would talk about small, like, if you went over a rail, it'd be a monkey. But if you dived into it, it was a Kong. And then Kong just kind of kind of replaced monkey completely, because it was more fun to say, I think. But Urban Freeflow, if you don't know the history had a pretty bad reputation. And so there is also a whole movement to try to get all the English speakers to use the French and the French is saut du chat. And that actually translates as cat jump. But they also call they also called vaults passement. Right. And so somehow, it came in as catpass became the, the purest way of talking about the the Kong vault in, in, in the UK. So every time that I've been in the UK, people just say catpass I've never heard anyone use the term Kong vault in the UK, they know about it. But that's been my experience.",860,216
4,9,interviewer,"It's, it's funny, you say that because I'm from the kind of London parkour scene. A few years removed now. But, you know, a few years ago, I was quite active with Parkour Generations in London. And I'm, I'm familiar with the term Kong vault, I would have said catpass was the one that wasn't used as much. So I'm wondering which groups maybe in the UK you might have encountered that were using catpass?",310,75
4,10,participant,"Well, I mean, so like, Storror uses catpass, my experience with them when I trained with PK Gen, I thought I remembered it being catpass, trying to remember because I've spent, I was at Rendezvous in 2007. And then I've been to the Chainstore and I've had [name] out here to teach a seminar. But he didn't teach any technical stuff, right? So I can't remember exactly what he would have used him and if I used Kong I'm sure he would have you know, just probably use whatever I was using, but it's it's always funny because sometimes when I talk to like, oh, like, last time I was in the UK I was turning with [name], you know, [name]? And [name]?",488,123
4,11,interviewer,"And who, sorry?",11,3
4,12,participant,"[name,] back in the day.",16,5
4,13,interviewer,"Yeah, that's that name is familiar. Yeah.",31,7
4,14,participant,Rage froobling. Remember rage froobling.,34,5
4,15,interviewer,"It's ringing bells, but I couldn't. I couldn't tell you why.",44,11
4,16,participant,"But yeah, so I'm pretty sure that [name] worked with [name]. He's worked, I think with everybody. But they are part of the I think they were both part of the kind of Parkour UK coaching group that was separate from [name], a bit of a rivalry there. I think [name] uses catpass, trying to remember, maybe this is interesting. Yeah, yeah. It'd be fun to do a survey. Yeah, terminology.",288,71
4,17,interviewer,"It's kind of not the, perhaps the main point of my study. But I have found it interesting to ask people about about the words, literally just the words. And it's, it's funny, trying to trace where they come from, as they, as they kind of spread through communities is quite interesting. But yeah, I hadn't heard that story about monkey becoming vault. Erm, becoming Kong, because of the size before. It's funny. I guess the next thing really to ask is, is just kind of very broadly, how would you describe a Kong vault? You know, what, what kind of movement is it?",435,104
4,18,participant,"I mean, my basic description would be a Kong vault is a vault where you dive towards an object or you vault over an object with both hands, and your body passes in between your arms, with your shoulders, in front of your hips through the entirety of the movement. So if a kash vault, the the legs swing through. And in a dash vault, obviously, the legs go first, right? Interestingly, in some of the French community, all of those are described as saut du chat. Anytime that you are basically diving to your hands, and any kind of way with both hands landing at the same time, but that's my the way that we've used it. And the way that we... Yeah, the way that we teach it is, if you're, if your hips stay behind your shoulders, and you're passing or with both hands, and it's symmetrical, then it's kong vault, you know, side a little bit or something, then it's not. Not really a kong vault, you know, it depends, might be a side vault might be just a shitty kong.",741,185
4,19,interviewer,"And so what, what kind of things would it be used for? I know, it's quite again, broad area. But-",71,20
4,20,participant,"Yeah, well, I would say that for a lot of the parkour community, it's used, because it looks cool. Because it's quite spectacular looking movement, right, or involves a bit committment, flying face first towards an object has a very aesthetic line to it in the air. So it's a fun way to to move. It's a compelling movement, I think it's one of the most most aesthetically pleasing things, it's one of the things that people want to put in their videos is like a big diving Kong vault, you know, or double Kong or big kong precision. My perspective is that Kong vaults, from an efficiency standpoint, are used to overcome wide distances into or out of them, right. So if you have to dive a long ways to reach an object to vault overit, then a Kong vault is the most appropriate thing. If you have to travel a long ways out of a vault, then a kong vault is the most appropriate thing. Other than that, it's, it's, it's not the best moment for in a lot of circumstances, or people tend to use it, because it involves a more complex loading strategy that takes longer and is more subject to failure than a simple running jump, which is essentially the way that we enter, step vault, speed vault, dash vault, lazy vault, all of those have a simple takeoff, or as a loading time. So and then the other thing is that because the hips are higher than the hands, or the hips are elevated, at sort of the level of the shoulders, I guess, the best way to describe this actually is essentially the hips are, have to be above the height of the legs, the legs are in between the hips and the object, you have to not clip the legs. That means that you displace your centre of mass more as you're going over an object which means that you have a longer flight time associated with Kong vault, than with dash vault, stepp or, speed or lazy, which actually makes it less efficient if you're trying to run rapidly from, from a vault from, you know, to get rapidly from running section through a vault to the next one, etcetera. So Kong vault, over a single medium sized obstacle is basically the slowest vault that we have. You have a series of, you know, if you say at a three foot high object that was, you know, a foot wide or half a foot wide, something like that six inches wide, and, you know, five yards in between each one and you ran through them, the fastest way to get across them would actually be a hurdle, just hurdle each one, as long as your strides sequence correctly, the next fastest would be a speed vault or a dash vault they're actually pretty comparable, in my experience, and then a kong or kash would be the slowest, maybe kash slower than they're both they both involve the same type of loading strategy. And then the time when you're swinging your hips through a kash, is can slow you down, depending on your mobility. But what [unclear] forward as you're landing coming out of the Kong is, disrupts your running gait, more than most other vaults as you're hitting the ground. And so it's harder to control running out of a Kong and to return quickly to a optimal sprinting form. But I don't know how many people actually think about that kind of thing.",2470,593
4,21,interviewer,"At least two. So quite a lot of information in there. What is it about the Kong you think then that makes it the slowest vault? is it just an efficiency thing? Is it, because you're diving forward onto the hands? Maybe? Are they braking in some way? Or like is that is it just takes longer in general?",233,59
4,22,participant,"Yeah. So we've tried to break down flow into a series of different characteristics, right? People talk about flow, but what allows good flow, so we break it down into is direction of inertia. So you have control of your direction of inertia, control of your displacement, over the object, control of your rhythm in moving through the object and control of your, your physical structure. So being in a position that allows you to apply force effectively to the environment. Risk management, right? So what's the likelihood that a movement will fail, right? Anytime that you slip or miss, that's going to slow you down, when you're trying to move fast. And the last thing is your ability to orient effectively. So if you cannot see the next thing that you have to move towards, then you're, there's going to be a delay in initiating the movements that you need. So a Kong vault, um... So just let's start with the idea of rhythm, right? So... well, this kind of rhythm and structure goes back a little bit, but your body naturally, like, just imagine for a second that you're sprinting as fast as you can. And you stop and hop in the middle of your sprint. How fast is that going to be? Versus just sprinting, right. So, so you have a structural pattern of gait that connects elements within a parkour sequence, right? Not always, sometimes you're connecting from parkour element to parkour element. But a lot of times you're connecting from parkour element to running to parkour out. So generally, the fastest movement within any sequence is going to be the movement that allows you to get out of and into your running gait with a minimal disruption to it. So a hurdle is a just a, an adaption of the running gait, right? It's the least disruption to the running gait, you can do, right. That vault, speed vault, a dash vault, all involve a essentially, standard running takeoff. You're simply running and jumping with a swing leg, into the vault phase in the air. So that's what I call it a simple take off. So simple takeoff is less complex for the nervous system takes less time to set up. So it's, it's more disruption structurally. So when you think about what's happening to Kong vault, you know, with a split step Kong, right, you, you're, you're going from putting one foot on the ground, and then another foot on the ground like one flight phase one, right to one, flight phase, one-two on the ground. Dropping your hips down, lowering your chest and bringing both arms behind you. So this is a massive disruption of your normal gait cycle. So necessarily, you brake and slow down substantially more, in the entry to a Kong, than you would for another skill, right? And then the displacement is the other aspect, right? So when we're going over an object, we do not want to go any higher than necessary, as we go over that object, because it's a waste of energy, it also means that we're gonna have a higher impact when we land on the other side, which we then have to absorb before we're able to effectively return to our gait. So that's, that's the disadvantage of the kong vault. Because, because you are displacing yourself. It's also the advantage, right? The reason that you can fly far into a Kong vault is because it gets the hips high, and creates all this potential energy that can be used to go forward. That's why you can Kong pre farther than you can dash pre or kash. It's because of that potential energy that's been created by elevating hips. So... so yes, so you're you're utilising a different structural strategy with your body that disrupts the inherent rhythm of running and involves a greater displacement of your centre of mass in order to pass the obstacle than the standard running jump vaults. The other aspect of the kong, is that, it, it's sort of it's not very adaptable to directional control. So you have a very strong inertial direction. In one way, saggitally, basically, right? And you are not, you're very committed to that. And you don't have the option to effectively change direction. So the step vault or lazy vault, it's much easier to, to cut a corner and go in whatever direction you want. So it gives you fewer options, as far as being able to [unclear] it. Also, you have, your, it's much more committing, you have once you dived into it, you can't really stop effectively on top of the object. I mean, you can very, very strong people, you'll see... will do that as a skill. But basically, you can't you can't decide in midair, that you're not going to continue, whereas with the step vault or a lazy vault often you can.",3565,825
4,23,interviewer,"So I guess one thing I'm curious about then is, is the running into the movement element... Is that, you know, there are ways, various ways to go in and out of these things. So is it does that stuff kind of apply if you're doing it from say, a plyometric movement, like a jump? Or? Or is the running, running in and running out element, kind of an integral part of the Kong vault? As you consider it?",304,79
4,24,participant,"Just the base, it's just the base case that we think about, right? There's other cases, like, you know, I think of parkour vault as tools that have specific applications. So if you're doing a movement preceding a vault that involves a two foot takeoff, right, that or sorry, that involves a two foot landing. Right, then often, a Kong vault is a relatively fluid movement to go out but you still have the problem that it's sort of catalyses you just going forward. And, and involves a lot of displacement of your hips, right? And so depending on somebody's mobility, if they're, if they're in that situation, they might want to pop through a kash vault, because then they're going to come up in a more athletic upright position on the other side. But that's, um, really has to do with shoulder mobility, which is a more optimal choice there and compression strength in the core. But yeah, so... if you had two vaults in a row, right, and they're, you know, close enough for a step or two, a couple steps between them, but not like really long ways away. A dash vaults into a Kong vault is very fluid. But a Kong vault into a dash vault is not very fluid at all. The same is true step vaults to Kong or lazy vault to kong and not vice versa because the Kong casts your chest forward. It's very difficult to then recover to an athletic posture and be able to get into a running jump step. So you'll see that those types of sequences much more commonly. You can do Kong to Kong or Kong to reverse vault, because reverse vault is basically a very similar type of takeoff to a Kong vault. But you'll, you just won't generally see somebody do a Kong vault and then do a dash vault right out of it because it structurally doesn't work well, so you need more options when you utilise a simple running step.",1400,337
4,25,interviewer,Okay. And...,7,2
4,26,participant,"Sorry, I've lost you. Just give me one second.",34,9
4,27,interviewer,Okay.,4,1
4,28,participant,"I use an external speaker, the speaker on my computer is broken, so it just died. [pause] Okay, that should be good now.",91,23
4,29,interviewer,Okay. Can you hear me?,16,5
4,30,participant,Nope. I don't hear you. Give me one second. How about now.,42,12
4,31,interviewer,"Can I, can you hear me?",16,6
4,32,participant,"Yep. Yep, we're good.",14,4
4,33,interviewer,"Okay, cool. That's great. That's, that's really, that's really in depth information that you're kind of giving me here, which is great. I'm curious is that, are those things that you've developed yourself? Over time?",165,35
4,34,participant,"Yeah. I don't think these are things that are sort of widely known. I'm, and I'm sure a lot of people in the parkour community would recognise intuitively that this is true. More experienced athletes are, have adopted this, but I don't think anyone else has taxonimised parkour in the same way that I have, that I know of.",252,59
4,35,interviewer,"Is that, erm, just for your own curiosity and interest in that? Or do you think that's something that we need to be doing in parkour? To understand it better?",123,30
4,36,participant,It depends on what you mean by parkour. Right?,36,9
4,37,interviewer,"It's, I guess, it's similar to, you know, what I'm saying at the start about the kong itself. It's a, it's a decentralised sport, people have their own opinions and ideas of what it is and isn't. So it's kind of difficult to say, I guess, you know, just kind of-",193,51
4,38,participant,"I think, I think it's a useful thing for anybody in the sport. But I had a particular you know, I, I started in 2005, and I got involved in the forums and all that stuff. And I, you know, went over to parkour dot net and was like, anti Urban Freeflow pro parkour. And, you know, we were told that parkour was, you know, efficiently getting from one place to another. And that's a shit definition, because we, the most efficient thing, most of the time moving through the city is to walk or run on the flat paths or stairways that have been provided for us. So when I started [name], co-founded [name], uh, I created a working definition for parkour for our group, which was Parkour is the discipline of developing the ability to overcome obstacles effectively, and of developing the self through overcoming obstacles. And I've had a chance to talk with Stephane and Sebastian and Thomas, about that, and they all think it's pretty good definition. The one thing that I've talked to them about is that I think that the emphasis in the beginning, especially with the Yamakasi, was much more on the development of the individual versus the way that the individual relates to the, the environment. But yeah, I mean, it's, it's one it's one definition of parkour that's useful. And I think that as far as the broader community is concerned, the best sort of description of Parkour is it's common practices. It's just a practice of challenging yourself through complex movements using, [unclear] obstacles in the environment, right, there's no, there's no real focus in the parkour community in general on effectiveness or efficiency, not as a, not as a central feature that everybody is is focused on. So I did a teaching seminar for [name], and I kind of laid out this theory for them. And then we talked a little bit about like, well, how would you adapt this for free runners right? It's like well, we can talk about what are the components of creating an aesthetic line? Right. Okay, talk about, you know, what is the amplitude of the movements, the novelty of the movements, the, you know, the lines that are created, you know, how do we think about shapes and the, the sort of visual interaction with the environment. It's been a while, that was back in 20... 2013. So I can't remember exactly what I came up with for them. But I think there's, there's more elements that sort of expand out from what Parkour is, once you start playing with the creative and aesthetic aspect of it. But, er, I think that understanding the basics of you know, control of inertia, control of displacement, control of rhythm, structure, orientation, and risk management is fundamental to anybody who wants to play with these things. And then being able to analyse each of the movements as tools that allow you to do that within a specific context is important. You know, I have analogized that a lot of parkour athletes essentially spend a lot of time getting, building new tools to put in their tool belt and don't realise that the practice is actually carpentry.",2391,542
4,39,interviewer,"I guess that def-, that idea of the things is a toolbox I've heard before. And just kind of bringing it back around to the Kong vault, do you consider the Kong vault to be a good thing for people to have in their toolbox?",171,45
4,40,participant,"Absolutely. It's a very useful movement. It's just utilised frequently a lot more than, than it would be useful for. Right? Right, you'll see, you know, you're gonna see people doing Kong vault over things that are knee high to precision, right? That's, that could stride that much more efficiently, which, and it's fine. It's fine to do. Right? There's nothing wrong with that, right? Because there will be lots of things that are inefficient in order to challenge ourselves and explore new options. What happens a lot with less experienced athletes or athletes who haven't applied this to say a speed run context, or haven't timed themselves haven't played with these things, is because the movement is aesthetic, and it has high prestige, they over apply. So when we run when, so we started some of the first speed competition through [name], back in 2011, no 2009, started in 2009. And what we found is that if we put a series of boxes out, you know, that were enough space to take a couple steps in between vaults that a large percentage of our athletes would default to using a kong vault. And, and it was always slow compared to the other options that we had. And so there's, there's just from an efficiency standpoint, or effectiveness standpoint, there tends to be an over emphasis on the skill, right. And reciprocally, something like the hurdle is almost completely undeveloped. And in a lot of contexts, it's by far the most efficient.",1137,252
4,41,interviewer,"Do you think people kind of default to the Kong vault then? Because it's kind of like a just a popular movement? Or is it like, it's, it's something that's kind of, I think you might have said, it looks good?",157,41
4,42,participant,"Yeah, it just looks like-...",19,5
4,43,interviewer,"[overlap] It's like, Yeah. Because the thing I always noticed is that whenever they put it in, like film or TV, that's what they kind of go for, because it's it's something that people go, Oh, that's parkour.",156,38
4,44,participant,"Yeah, yeah. It's kind of emblematic.",27,6
4,45,interviewer,"Hmm. Yeah, that's a really good word.",27,7
4,46,participant,"Yeah, it's emblematic of parkour. And it's something that a good athlete from another sport can't automatically do. Right? Like, a good football player will self organise a speed vault or a hurdle or a lazy even in a chase context, right. But you generally have to have trained it in order to have access to a Kong vault. So it's a bit of a separator, right? It sort of says, I am a parkour athlete.",308,76
4,47,interviewer,"Do you think, erm, and it's maybe it's coming through experiences as a coach as well now... Is it something that's easy or difficult for people to learn?",117,28
4,48,participant,"It's one of the more difficult, you know, the, what you might call the base vocabulary of vaults. It's probably the most difficult of the basic vaults, right? This is a toss up between that and the kash but, um. Generally, the Kong vault is more limited by fear and by strength, whereas the kash is more limited by mobility. So if you're working with a population of say, you know, really strong muscle bound young men, they'll kong more easily than they'll kash. But for, you know, a more mixed population, you'll find the kash might come easier.",424,99
4,49,interviewer,"And I noticed you said, fear, as well as strength. Is it something that people people are scared of? As a movement?",89,22
4,50,participant,"Yeah, yeah, it's, it's quite a scary movement, because there's a sense that you can clip your feet or your knees, and that you'll be tumbling headfirst, if you do so. And just even the idea of diving headfirst at an object is kind of scary. Right? So yeah, I think, definitely more fear involved. And there is a higher potential of of taking a bad fall from a Kong vault than from any of the other vaults.",311,78
4,51,interviewer,"So what, I guess what kind of, how might you break it down for someone learning? In that case?",72,19
4,52,participant,"Yeah. What we've gone to is just having people practice konging up onto things. And getting them comfortable with that. And then we sort of work on konging up further onto something. So if you know, you know, you're konging up on a six inch wide box, and then maybe have a two foot wide thing and you just kong from one side to the other, then you take them back to the six foot, six inch box and just have them kong and use the same strategy to get far over the kong they come down on the other side. In the past, we played a lot with like Kong vault on the ground as a way to progress up. But we found that those were not necessary in a lot of contexts, once we moved to training primarily in nature, where we have a bit more rounded surfaces more likelihood to have soft landing spaces. The other thing that happens a lot in nature is you'll have branches that have a little bit of a dip in them that provide really nice services for learning, the kong or the kash flow, because it's easier to get the feet through without clipping. And so we found with with with that set of constraints, we didn't need to use a kind of a ground kong based strategy to accomplish it for our athletes.",930,233
4,53,interviewer,"So if I'm curious if the kind of version on the floor was not, does that translate very well to doing it on an obstacle? Do you think or does that? Is it? Is there something different about? I guess I'm thinking of the dive on a completely flat floor versus diving up? Or kind of in an arc, or anything like that?",241,63
4,54,participant,"Yeah, I mean, obviously, there are differences, right, the idea of teaching it on the floor is that you're just learning to feel comfortable diving onto your hands and then driving the hands down and back in order to get some flight after the hands contact without taking the risk of falling from a two or three foot high obstacle, right. The reason that I've moved away from that is one, I just found that the athletes didn't need it. But the other is that I'm very, very kind of deep in ecological dynamics slash constraint led approach to learning. I don't think that it's everything, I do cue people and use a cuing language. But within the motor learning research, what they find is that if you atomize a skill more in development of the skill, then you're actually more likely to see the athlete have the skill sort of separate into its component pieces under pressure. So the more that you can get an athlete to sort of adaptively have access to the skill as a whole thing, the better the athletes retention of that skill over time is. So when you're working with a novice athlete, you part of it is they have a motor control, like lack of understanding of the skill. But the other thing is that you might just have an athlete who's not physically strong enough, and not physically mobile enough. And a lot of times, it's better to just address those components and then let them self organise the skill. So what we found with many of the vaults is that they self organised given the right task demands. So rather than teaching the step vault, what we'll do is we'll go out and find a couple of tree branches, or maybe a couple of rails in the city and just say go under this one and go over that one. Right. Something like that. And you'll what you'll find is that most people can figure out how to do a step vault, and it will naturally occur. And then most people will also do a one handed lazy, right? And maybe a lazy with both hands touching. And then you can, you can, you can just nudge the skill a little bit to get them to put their hands down. Alright, to get them to get control of the hand positioning. And even the Kong, the Kong vault, people will self organise coming up onto things, right, they will do that naturally. So we try to put them in a context where it's like, get up on top of this thing, and that becomes the obvious way to do it. And then we can watch, then we can shape the skill, once it's there a little bit, you could say, Okay, well, now I want you to get all the way over it. Right? You know, watch how the athlete behaves. And then, you know, you can put a different context in front of it, that that makes them that elicits the behaviour more that shapes the behaviour in the direction. So, sometimes we're able to do that successfully. And sometimes we need to use more cuing to kind of give information to the athlete, and depends on the context of like how, how much time you have to work with the athlete and kind of what the what the progression, you know, that you're trying to achieve in a specific timeframe looks like, but I would default to taking more time to give the athlete the physical resources to achieve the Kong vault and more context in which it just makes sense to utilise that skill. And less technical cuing information is going to be a more robust pathway in the long run, in my opinion, even though you're likely to get the, this, the shape of the skill earlier, if you do more kind of technique drilling and cuing of it.",2734,662
4,55,interviewer,"I'm, I'm curious, because you use the word context for the movement there what, what might, what might the context for a kong vault be? If it's not the fastest movement?",130,31
4,56,participant,"So... Well, the first one is that you use it to get up on things, konging up is very natural, right. So if you're, if you're approaching, you know, like, imagine a loading dock, right, you're running up towards a loading dock, and you want to get on top of the loading dock. If you imagine that you want to be in a good running position, symmetrically with both feet on the object as quickly as possible, often a Kong up is the fastest movement, right? If you swing, if you do like a step vault mount, getting your body back into position to get to have both feet under, you have more of a problem of direction of inertia with that lazy vaults don't work as mounts at all, or dash vaults, right. So you're, you're basically your two options are some kind of two hands support, or one hand in one foot support, those are the two things that you're going to do to get up on top of something. So if you get people comfortable getting on top of things by using that strategy, then they're they're not so far away from a kong vault. And if you're running around in the natural world, right, like we're kids, you know, might in, in, you know, more evolutionary past, like you're running around on fallen logs and rocks and stuff like that, that task demands going to come up, a lot of people will self organise this skill, it's a natural skill for human beings, what's less natural is something like flying 10 feet out of it, right, that's more of a, a particular context that we've built. But you know, once someone can get up onto something, you can focus them on just getting further down the thing that they're getting up on, and then you can have them target going over across something instead. So then something you know, like, with my son, six years old, and so he's playing with some of these skills, you know, so he kind of naturally was doing a sort of knees to the side, Kong vault, right. So, like a context that we can put in front of him is that you need to land on something and stop on it right. And so now the knee swing around the side is going to, is going to be potentially less useful because it's going to create more of a wobble when you land. So the kong to precision actually is a way to, to make obvious to the athletes self organisation that, that having the legs pass in between the arms is is a better, is a better strategy or tactic.",1820,452
4,57,interviewer,"And so if if you have an athlete that did me more of the like, cuing side of things, if perhaps just the context stuff wasn't getting it across them or they weren't getting it in straight away what kind cues might, might be looking at giving them? Or, what, what kind of sticking points might people have with the movement?",254,61
4,58,participant,"Yeah, so there's a few different, like, there's a bunch of different aspects of the kong you can look at. And so one aspect is the takeoff, right, because once we are more advanced, then we need to specifically address how we do the splits, foot takeoff, which shows up not just in the Kong vault, but as I mentioned, also in the reverse vault, and, uh, running front and side flips, right? You see this same basic takeoff structure, in all of them. My, my nice webcam died. So that is a less natural movement for people in some ways. So it takes a lot you can, you can get benefits from a little bit more specific focus. So that's, that's one thing that we can cue and then we have the what the arms are doing and how they interact with the object, like a very classic error that we see with athletes is having their arms out in front and kind of reaching forward with them as they vault. And the problem with that is that if the hand is still moving forward, when it contacts the object, it makes it much more likely that someone is going to slip. So you need to cue athletes are often a very important cue to give athletes is to pull the object back and behind them. Giving them a target to land on that's further away will also tend to elicit that same behaviour, right? Because they're having to, they're trying to get somewhere, right. And then there's, you know, the legs deviating to one side or popping one hand up early, right? To get through. And again, having a target that you're going towards, provides context for why that's less optimal. So then cues again, it's like, you know, drive down and back with both hands, right? If you can get that and then, you know, keep your legs in between your, in between your hands. You know, that's a pretty classic one. And then when we when we look at the, the, the split step, what I tend to do is have people stand where they can take one step and drop into it. And and then just, you know, it's it's obviously better to sort of take that step, right. And so then if they hop and go to two feet, then I can put a barrier and say, Okay, well, only one leg can go past this barrier. With the arms, you know, we we cue, the arm should be down swinging forward, and then pull back. So those are some of the cue structures that we use.",1757,443
4,59,interviewer,"I've heard that described as like a scoop. Maybe, yeah,",42,10
4,60,participant,"Yeah. That's a good one, scoop.",22,6
4,61,interviewer,"Is that kind of the arms on the obstacle part, is that contributing to maybe distance? Or is it just to kind of-",87,23
4,62,participant,You can control your distance.,25,5
4,63,interviewer,"Yeah, right.",9,2
4,64,participant,"So so you're pressing down, so your, your, your body is pushing down into it, so that's giving elevation and then you're adding momentum by pulling on the object. You're, that's not the most powerful component of the moment. I've never seen a biomechanical breakdown of how much the legs versus the arms are contributing to the movement forward. The arm swinging actually is quite is quite important because having the arm swing as your contacting the ground having them swing down, it adds momentum going down into the ground which increases ground reaction force. That's why you see you know in a counter movement jump-",498,106
4,65,interviewer,This is in the takeoff?,18,5
4,66,participant,"In take off. Yeah. Years ago [name], if know [name] is extremely talented parkour athlete from [name], he you know, he was one of the first guys who did like triple Kongs on video. He told me that basically he thought the arms did almost nothing and that he could Kong almost as far off of two fingers as he could off of his whole hands. But [name] who is my my, the co founder at [name], he had a very unique style is extremely powerful and muscular and his upper body and he could achieve kind of massive distances out of the press with his arms and you can see it you know, we have a video of him doing like a double Kong where the first one was 36 inches and the Second was 48 inches, with like a six foot gap between them. And you can look and you can watch how his arms are bending and pressing in order to elevate his body more to go over. And so is kind of he was kind of a joke in the parkour community because his his upper body strength was so exceptional relative to other people that he had a different set of options. And so we kind of joked that he was like a gorilla and drug, drug his lower body around by his arms. So yeah, so it depends on the athlete and their, their structure.",929,241
4,67,interviewer,"So would it, I guess, would it be fair to say that, you know, that kind of upper body strength can play a role, but it's it's not kind of... It's not the most usual way? That people-",132,38
4,68,participant,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I would say that. The, the, the timing of the swing, and the way that it hits helps the action of the legs and assists always right. And that very powerful athletes in their upper body can can gain advantage in pushing. But the advantage gained by having a more powerful upper body is less than having a better time, more rhythmic and more elastic, lower body. And so you can see there's, there's quite a few, you know, I mean, [name] is actually exceptionally strong in his upper body, so maybe that's a bad example. He's kind of skinny. But I mean, you know, he's insanely powerful with his dynos and stuff like that. But you see, some athletes who are quite slender and you know, don't necessarily have like really powerful climb ups who can Kong vault extreme distances, because just the power of their legs.",646,151
4,69,interviewer,So the takeoff kind of gives them a lot of power. And then the upper body is just to kind of pass the obstacle?,86,24
4,70,participant,Yeah.,4,1
4,71,interviewer,"So that on the kind of, we talked a lot about the takeoff and the obstacle, like on the other side of it, what, what kind of thing might you be looking for, for good Kong vault?",135,37
4,72,participant,"Well, once you get into advanced kong vaulting, and there's really two different skills that we call Kong vaults that are related, but have some require different things. And that's a vault to precision and a diving vault. So in a vault to precision, you want your hips to sort of be rising and below your shoulders the whole time. In a diving vault, your hips go over your shoulders. So when you're doing a Kong to precision, one of the key things is actually not letting your hips elevate too high relative to your shoulders during the passage over the object. You know, aside from that, you know, essentially you're just correcting for your rotation in the air, and tucking up and reaching out as you would on any jump in order to accomplish, you know, as much distance based on the parabola of force that you've created. But that's, that's the big thing is that if you, if you're doing a kong to precision, and you let your hips elevate too high, you're you've basically created a shorter, tighter arc rather than a longer arc. [unclear] But on a dive, you know, getting those hips high is very, very important because you have to catch on the other side and have time for your legs to translate through. So you see the best, the best guys in the in the double Kong dive kong, often have, you know, almost like a 45 degree angle when they're coming into the end of that, that that, you know, the the second or last the you know, the final hand placement.",1139,270
4,73,interviewer,"One thing I find curious is when we start talking about other movements that are kind of distinct but still within like the Kong family of movements, or do you think they are... Like, is it just literally that two hands feet through the middle thing that kind of connects them all? Or are they, do they share more than just a kind of aesthetic?",272,65
4,74,participant,"Well, um, so you can break you can break things down in different ways. So you can look at how is the athlete taking off? How is the athlete landing and how is the athlete moving over the object? So I tend to think of the complex takeoffs and we'll call them you know, for lack of a better term. Those are the takeoffs were both feet on the ground during the takeoff phase, the two foot takeoff jumps right. That's the Kong vault, the, the reverse vault, the and the kash vault basically. And then you know, Kong front [unclear] whatever. Double leg, uh, you know, all th fun- funky ones. And then then step vault, lazy vault, dash vault. And hurdle all takeoff have a standard running step. And then you have some, some things like gate vaults and chest vaults, and swing leg reverses, which are a little bit different, you know, a little bit, you know, kind of neither. But that's the way that I break them down. So, a Kong vault and the kash vault, they're very closely related to each other, the fundamental difference is just whether the shoulders stay in front or the hip swing through to move to the end of it. I find that a kash vault is much easier on my body, when I'm doing it say, over something high. That we know that having my hips and having my hips get lowered, before my hands leave the object allows me to land much more softly on the side, also has a really nice control factor. I discovered this when I was training, I got, uh, I like to move in trees, right. So I was teaching and in Australia, and we have this incredible banyan trees, you know, and so I found these trees where I was able to do you know, parkour lines on tree branches, you know, 30 feet off the ground. And I found that a lot of times, you know, that the position that your hands are in is higher than the position your legs have to travel through. And that a kash vault gives you a lot of ability to sort of swing through and land symmetrically on an object and not have any inertia moving in the wrong direction. Or even a step vault can be very, very intimidating, when you're trying to land on a relatively narrow branch 30 feet off the ground. Because it has that small... Step vault, has a natural tendency to fall off to one side, and has a natural circular momentum. So, so I quite like those for for control when we're doing the kash vault. Um... But when we're teaching the kash vault, when we're teaching the Kong vault, I tend to teach the kong vault first. But many athletes will self organise a kash vault when you ask them to do a kong vault. And when they do that, I always just said that is this vault, it's really useful. We'll practice that for a while. And then we'll try to bridge back to the kong vault from it. If you can, if you can do a kash vault rather than a Kong vault, we will give you a gold star for getting a really cool vault. We keep you doing it for a while because it's, it's useful for you. And then we return to the Kong vault and say, okay, here's the manipulations, the changes we need you to make in order to achieve this other vault that has these other purposes. And then, and then you have something like you know, like a two foot takeoff, lazy vault, right, or a two foot takeoff dash vault, which occur in certain situations. And so those are somewhere hybrid in between these types of skills, right? I don't tend to spend a lot of time teaching those basically, once. Once athletes are sufficiently advanced, they, they'll they'll sort of find those, right, like you pop down. You know, we talked about the situation where you're, you're not running into an object, but you're actually landing out of another. So you do an underbar and you land and then you're going to vault, right? And so you're not going to step into the vault, you're going to be bouncing into the vault. And so you can bounce into a kong and you can bounce to a kash and bounce into a lazy, right? Maybe a dash. Athletes who, once they're really sequencing those type of things. They kind of have the ability to self organise and figure out what's going to work in that situation. Especially if they have clear goals on like, get here fast, you know.",3218,793
4,75,interviewer,"I'm conscious of the time. I'm gonna monopolise your morning too much. Yeah. We've we've actually covered a lot of the kind of main points that I try and get to with people. It's been really really great, really interesting. I guess just to kind of to wrap up if there's anything, anything more to add that's kind of popped into your head at any point maybe we didn't get to.",289,71
4,76,participant,"No, no, now I'm just like, man, I need to publish this stuff I haven't like it all exists behind my, to some degree behind paywalls on the, you know people buy my online courses, right all the all this stuff, but maybe I'd love to put out some some longer kind of like nice, nice content that just sort of broke down why, why the skills have these relationships, what the basics of flow are. But yeah, just just reminds me of that. But yeah, I hope I hope it was useful.",359,93
4,77,interviewer,"Yes. Very, thank you. Cool. I think in that case, then if, well I guess, to finish the thing, I've been kind of asking people, and I'm not sure. I'm not sure what your answer will be for this, because I think you've maybe thought about these things in a different way. But is there... Is there anything about the Kong vault that you would like to find out if you are able to take it into a lab and have like, all the sports science kind of equipment? Is there things that you're curious about in terms of? Or...",386,100
4,78,participant,"Yeah, I mean, one of the big ones that just popped up in our conversation is what is the contribution of the upper body to the total force applied during a Kong vault, right? So like, if you could look at, you know, force plate on the ground, force plate on the hands and say, you know, how much of the, the the distance attained, how much of the total force was contributed by the lower body versus the upper body? That'd be quite interesting to me. You could do you know, I don't think you need a laboratory to find out the other questions that I have about it. I think that those are mostly contextual. And you can see it and you can just time it, right, like I've done frame by frame analysis of like, speed runs. And I can, you know, I can see that, like, you know, so when [name] route did a dive, dive Kong over two rails as part of a series, uh, part of a course, right. And some of the athletes slid under those two rails and some of the athletes did strides over those two rails, Yon had an amazing time. But if you watch it frame by frame, you can see that he loses time compared to almost every other athlete in that specific sequence. Because there's no necessity for that movement, right? A stride is faster. And in that context, or even the slide was faster at that context. So I mean, it would be fun to sort of test out different, different places, different sequences, right, coming out of this skill. But, I mostly think that you can just test that yourself by going out into your environment saying, okay, here's the here's the series of obstacles, I'm going to timee myself using a Kong vault here versus using a different skill. I mean, my basic thesis is that if you can use another skill to accomplish the same effect, you're usually better off doing so. Right? I mean, I guess the one exception to that would be that, sometimes you like you can do dive reverse vaults, right. And they're like, a lot of times, if you try to dive into Kong vault, if you try to do a dive Kong, and you're not going to make it your knees are going to clip than the default, the bail strategy is to reverse vault, you turn your shoulder and it allows your hips to transit over the object lower. But the problem with that is that you now have disrupted your orientation. And when you have a longer perceptual lag when you hit the ground, and you're less optimal structure to keep moving forward. So if you can make the kong rather than the dive, reverse, it's better and, it's interesting, you never see people really practice big diving reverses. But yeah, I mean, that that's, that's my thesis, I think you can test it, that athletes can empirically test it out themselves, most people just haven't have a thought to do it. But relative control contributions would be good. I mean, you could test some of the things that would be interesting is if you look at, if you look at the takeoff in a Kong vault, it's very, very similar to the takeoff for a dunk if you watch people dunk but if you watch-",2327,571
4,79,interviewer,In basketball?,12,2
4,80,participant,"Yeah, if you watch a two foot basketball takeoff on the dunk, you'll see the same positions moved through largely that you see on a Kong vault or a a guy front or side ball, side foot. Now, when you do a Kong flip- Kong vault or a front flip generally the feet will be pointed directly forward towards the direction of travel. When you do a dunk they will be slanted like this. So one curiosity is can we use some of the spiralling  asymmetry to get a little bit more power and be able to correct the hips in the air? Or do we sort of need to, right is this, is this, is this the optimal strategy that we've, that we've already found? Or is there a little bit of that we can steal from basketball? I suspect that we've probably already found it but be an interesting thing to look at. The other is like, there's all sorts of interesting things like if you start looking at the basketball, the analysis of basketball takeoffs, there's a lot of stuff that you could look at in like the the action of the arms, right, like, you know, like [unclear] talks about arm flaps versus arm swings. So where where do the arms come through. And you know how the athlete loads, like how they get their hip down and roll over the foot. And looking at the relative contribution of the blocking or the the penultimate step versus the blocking step. Like all those, there's probably interesting questions that you could, you could generate around that and get some information that athletes could take into sort of cue their practice on how to do things better. But I'd have to think a little bit more about how to shape those questions in order to get useful data out of it. But that's, that's some directions you could look at.",1343,322
4,81,interviewer,"That's really interesting what you said about basketball, because that had never occurred to me before. But as soon as you say it, I can kind of picture it in my head that the rhythm of the feet and things like that is, yeah I can see that. That is very interesting. Okay, cool. All right. That's good. Then I'll stop the recording. If you could just bear with me one second.",289,72
5,1,interviewer,"...start the recording. All right. So. Good afternoon. Good morning for you, actually. Thank you for, thank you for coming along so early in the morning. So just very quickly, just to check, thank you for sending back the informed consent form with the signature on it. Was there any questions about anything, any of the information in there that you wanted to double check? Okay. And similarly, thank you for doing the background, detail thing. That was all great. Just one thing I wanted to ask quickly, says on there that you're not currently coaching, is that, um, although you're not active, are you still kind of with a coaching group? Or is that just you're not coaching at all?",534,121
5,2,participant,"So I'm not coaching at all right now. I have a, I have a spine injury. So I'm not doing a lot of training in general. But I do sort of, we take a hiatus during the winter, but we have like a weekly women's group that I organise, and do a bunch of the sort of facilitating of people's movement there. I guess. I'm not like, we don't use the term coach, because it's a community. But we will be starting that up again in a few months. So I'm not actually you know, I'm not, I'm not actually coaching right now or training, but that will be happening soon.",416,111
5,3,interviewer,"Okay. And that, um, those training sessions, they're are they part of [name]? Are they completely independent thing?",90,18
5,4,participant,"They are independent, but it's, it's basically the women from the [name] community, and then we do some outreach on their behalf. So like, we have we have, we're definitely not we don't belong to them. But we have like flyers for their business. And when people come over and say, like, Hey, what do you guys doing? You know, we let them know, most of the people who train in that group train with [name].",307,76
5,5,interviewer,"Okay, cool. So the the main thing that I'm kind of looking at with this study, is trying to get an understanding of how people and coaches kind of understand the Kong Vault for themselves. The kind of reasoning for that is that, you know, there's no central rulebook or, or guidelines or framework for parkour, it's not like a sport that's been enshrined in some kind of central organisation, although some of that stuff is starting to happen with governing bodies and things like that. And so when it comes to performing studies on the movements, it's kind of a little bit, it's very open. How do you know that when I'm doing a Kong vault is the same as someone else's? How do I know if I'm studying that? I'm not just studying one person who's doing something very unique to them? And I'm going, ah the Kong vault everyone does it with you know, they do a triple handstand first? And then they do and with? Like, no, no one does that. It's just that one person. So I'm just trying to talk to a whole bunch of people about about the vault. It's, the questions can be quite broad. You know, I've got some notes written down for where I want to, what I want to talk about that. We'll see where it takes us as well. So don't feel that there's any kind of like, right or wrong answers. Just , just go with that. Cool. Any. Any questions before we get started?",1042,257
5,6,participant,No.,2,1
5,7,interviewer,"Okay. I mean, I guess I should check. First of all, do you know what I mean by Kong vault? Is that the term that you use?",89,27
5,8,participant,"Yeah, yeah, that's the term we use, me. Sometimes there's a bit of confusion, um, like in America, I think people tend to say Kong vault, but I have run into people who say Monkey Vault instead. And I think sometimes there's a little bit of sometimes people will define that slightly differently. But I, Kong is the, is a word we would use in the sort of north of Boston community.",294,72
5,9,interviewer,"Okay. Do you, do you know, perhaps where you first heard it? Is it is it just the word that everyone uses? Or is it particular to anything?",106,28
5,10,participant,"It's pretty like pretty much in our in our sort of standard lexicon of like, Oh, you know, today in class, we're gonna work on this thing. I don't know that there was like a particular video or anything that was first showed to me that was like, this is the thing I think it's just like a sort of a name brand vault that you would learn in class.",266,70
5,11,interviewer,"Okay. In that case, then with the Kong vault, just kind of curious, let's say starting really broad, how would you describe it just in your own words?",116,28
5,12,participant,"Okay, so...",6,2
5,13,interviewer,In as much or as little detail as you want.,33,10
5,14,participant,"So a Kong is a vault that uses like a feet hands feet pattern as many of like our vaults do. But you do two hands at the same time and typically propel yourself forward over an obstacle. And they're they're sort of variations that we would also kind of put in the Kong family of like a side vault where you don't necessarily go forward, but you put your hands down, and then you hop your feet sideways and don't necessarily have to do they're like feet, through the space where your hands were movement. But in a standard vault that I would consider a Kong, just like a normal Kong, you put your hands on the obstacle, and then you hop your feet through the space where your hands initially were, and you press with your hands to pull your chest and shoulders out of that space to make room for the clearance of your feet.",649,158
5,15,interviewer,Okay.,4,1
5,16,participant,"I think I tend to see it done. Perhaps not equally... in equal measure, but you see people doing it both as sort of a split step coming in or a punch coming in. I wouldn't say either of those wasn't a kong, I think it's just a different setup for it.",188,52
5,17,interviewer,"I'm really curious that you use the word normal, as in a normal kong. Is that... Is there like, um, yeah, I guess like a main version of it, that comes to mind when you hear the word kong vault.",144,40
5,18,participant,"So I think, um... in a lot of the, like my community I think has proportionately a large number of adults practising and, and adults who came to the sport as as adults who didn't start out training when they're 15, 16 years old. And so a lot of the the Kongsthat these people are doing or I shouldn't put it in air quotes, a lot of the Kongs that these people are doing are not the, the sort of standard sort of straight on Kong, you know, you would you would side Kong in those instances, or, you know, it's just a little bit less taxing on the body. I was told pretty early on in pretty damagingly in my training that I was not a real parkour practitioner until I could do a Kong.",526,136
5,19,interviewer,Really?,6,1
5,20,participant,"Yeah, it was it was framed as this like this barrier to entry, this gateway of like, I, I can't respect you as a practitioner until you can do this. And I was told that by a coach, and it sort of led me on this very self destructive, three or four months long quest to do a kong, which was like, a really painful part of my parkour experience. It was like, a time where I was very frustrated, I felt like I didn't deserve to work on anything I like doing until I nailed this thing. And so I was like, just sort of hammering it constantly. I had every coach I think we have maybe 15 coaches in our community or like coach adjacent people who all sat down with me and tried to help me, tried to troubleshoot, they all wanted to be the person who like unlocked it for me. Um, you know, and any just wasn't working, it was extraordinarily frustrating. And so I think, in my mind, and not rightfully so the, the straight on sort of perpendicular Kong is, is like, the real kong that is like the difficult one, that's the barrier for entry, as opposed to sort of the side Kong. Which it would be great if we consider that as like, you know, as interesting or as cool as a normal Kong, but for me, because there was that barrier put in place it like, yeah, that definitely affects how I would describe it. Even though I recognise that that's like, that was a damaging perspective that was like, imparted upon me.",1088,273
5,21,interviewer,"Do you know why they maybe had that view of it? Why it's, why it was considered so important, in a way?",77,22
5,22,participant,"I... it's hard to tell if this is like a widely held viewpoint, because this person was like a particularly intense person, but also someone that like, I wanted to train with and like, you know, wanted to be on their good side, I guess. So. Um, you know, I think it was just like, in his mind, it was Like just a, like, a hard thing that if you can't do, you're not part of the group. But it was specifically the barrier of entry for being a practitioner. I mean, it wasn't like, Oh, you know, like a kong these other things, you have to be able to, like, do rail pres or do any of this other stuff. It was it was the Kong that was the thing.",479,131
5,23,interviewer,"Just the one, the ones main movement.",29,7
5,24,participant,Just the one movement. And it sucked. It was like it was a really difficult three months.,70,17
5,25,interviewer,"Yeah, I bet that's, I've not encountered that anywhere else. Okay. That's really curious. So just coming back to your learning it then what, what was, what were some of the things that were kind of stopping you getting it? Just out of curiosity.",190,44
5,26,participant,"You know, I think at the end of the day, part of it was just like... like, there's so much in parkour or just like, believing that you can do it and not having your mind put the brakes on at the last second is like really important. And I think at the end, that's what it came down to. Because when I finally did my first one, I was training with someone else. And he was like, really struggling with something. I was really struggling with this. And he was like, it was like, the end of the day, we were both exhausted. And he was like, Alright, I'm gonna nail on this one. And then you're gonna now yours and then we're gonna go home. And then he nailed it. There's sort of this, like, just psychological moment of like, Alright, like, 100% commitment here. 110% commitment. And then like, it happened, and it like, totally blew my mind. Because it's something that I've been, like, just like rote practising for for literally months at that point.",724,179
5,27,interviewer,Mmm.,3,1
5,28,participant,"So it was like, kind of a magical moment, but then I like told the person who initially told me that I wasn't a practitioner until I could do a Kong. I was like, You should have been there today. Like, I did a Kong and he was like, I was busy. Like, he was like, so not impressed. And it was like, it was crazy, because he was such like a, it was such a pivotal thing that he had said to me, like it was the thing that really was burned into my understanding of myself as a practitioner, and whether or not I got to be part of that community where I got to consider myself, you know, someone who did parkour, it was it made such an impact on me. And then like, for him sort of not the same. Like he did not care at all, even though we were like good friends at that point. He it just like, I don't know, the whole thing was like a weird, disheartening, frustrating moment until, like, when I tried, when I teach Kongs. I try to do it very differently.",723,194
5,29,interviewer,"Well, I was just about to ask if you now share his point of view, when it comes to coaching it with other people.",87,24
5,30,participant,"I do not I, you know, I don't think anyone needs to learn a Kong, I still do not regularly use them because they're not comfortable for me. And I don't think that there's any minimum barrier for entry. There's someone in our community who really tried to recruit people into our 50 plus class, we have like, an older folks class. And he tells them, if you get out of bed in the morning, you're doing a roll and a height change. So like, there's no like, there's no minimum for doing parkour. And I think that's a perspective that I'm much more comfortable with. And I think in particular, because I work with a lot of women, it's really important to have that as part of our like, like, the respect level in our community space is that like, everyone who shows up here today, to like, train or to have fun, or just to play or just to see what it's about, like, everyone is part of this. And it's okay, if you if there's something you can't do or don't want to try, or, you know, if you're tired, if you're just gonna sit on the ground and stretch next to us, like, that's fine, you're still you're still a part of our movement community. And I think, I know, perhaps I perhaps I've sort of swung the opposite way in terms of [unclear] pendulum, and want to have a super inclusive approach to parkour. But also, I think, when we're talking about women's parkour, you have to be very inclusive, because it's difficult to recruit women to parkour. It's difficult to retain them once you have them there.",1145,283
5,31,interviewer,"Okay, cool. So if it's, if, erm, so not thinking of it as like a requirement to say you can do parkour. Do you still think the Kong vault is an important move to try and learn in parkour or is it something that is, I don't know, not required, but it's like a fundamental movement, or do you think it's just, just another one on the list?",254,68
5,32,participant,"Yeah, I mean, in that it's part of our vocabulary of movement. I think it's useful for everyone to like, know what it is and try it. If it doesn't work for you, I don't think that matters at all. Um. But I do think that, you know, same as like, if you're learning parkour, you're going to learn, or you're going to know what a lazy vault is, or you're going to, like, have exposure to these other vaults or these other movements, you know, you're going to know what QM is, you're going to have all these things that are just part of our vocabulary. You know, if you do it long enough, you're gonna run into the Kong. And I think that's, there's nothing inherently wrong with that.",512,131
5,33,interviewer,"But it's, you don't view it as like, essential or something, something that someone has to get?",73,17
5,34,participant,"No, I mean, I think, I think our proper practices are pretty personal. And because we don't have this sort of curriculum of how to learn parkour, and how to teach parkour, if something is like, very difficult for you, for whatever reason, like I am very small, and like, I am lady shaped, and all the people trying to teach me to Kong were like, men with a typical athletic build where a foot taller than I was.",318,79
5,35,interviewer,Mm.,2,1
5,36,participant,"And I think their understanding of how to do the movement was different from what actually made sense for my body at the end of the day. And I think, if no one had... I think, if no one had sort of framed the Kong as something that I needed to learn to do, I would have had a much more healthy relationship with my entire parkour practice during that period where I was going to do it. So I don't think it's like, like, if you want to be on a team, and you want to, like compete, or you want to, like, have an elite level practice, like, yeah, you should, like, master your movement and learn all the things that you can, but if you hate them, there's no reason to do them. Like there's no, it's not like, like, I don't know, I want to say like, it's not like swimming, where to get to an Olympic level, you have to be able to kick your feet well, and fast and strongly, you know, it's like, there's just, theres, because there's no structure in parkour right now of, you know, like, yeah, we have some competitions, we have some, some versions of that, but none of it requires you to do a Kong and it doesn't, you know, if you don't like it, if it doesn't make sense for your body, if it's just like a huge point of frustration for you, I don't think that like, we need to put a sort of moral weight on whether or not you get to be a part of the community based on any individual movement.",1048,278
5,37,interviewer,"So is there kind of a feeling that there's always other options? You know, there's nothing that perhaps a kong, like that only a kong could achieve something in that, in whatever situation? There's always some option?",172,37
5,38,participant,"Yeah, I think usually there's like a, something you can swap in for that. It's not like parkour's choreographed. It's not like there's someone saying, okay, here's the dance, we're all gonna do identically to each other. It's not like that. And I don't know, I think some there's something like very personal about everyone's movement and their style of movement and what they enjoy doing. And you know, I don't think that has to include any movement that people are not comfortable with, like, I don't know, like if someone doesn't like heights, and they don't want to train at height, and then they don't want to, like jump off a roof. Nobody's gonna be like, well, you're not a parkour practitioner, if you're not jumping off a roof. Right. Like, they're, they're still playing, they're still doing the vaults or the swings or, you know, whatever it is. It's not, um, I dunno, I think everyone's practices as individual as they are, in many ways.",724,167
5,39,interviewer,"Yeah, I would definitely agree with that. Okay. Do you still... do you think it's, it's a popular movement, though?",85,20
5,40,participant,Oh yeah.,6,2
5,41,interviewer,So kind of... Yeah?,12,4
5,42,participant,"People love kongs, I think. I mean, they look cool. I think they're an easy way to like impress people who don't do parkour and they like, they look like a lot of fun. I often teach parkour... or I often teach Kongs to the women who are in my group sometimes because they want to learn it sometimes because I think that they ah, need a challenge at that point. And, you know, I don't think that it's not a useful vault. I don't think it's not a popular vault. And I also don't think that it's not worth trying to learn. I'm glad that I, you know, put in the hours to make it happen. Mostly it happened in a more positive way, but I'm glad that I can do it. So... does it, yeah, it's definitely popular people like it.",537,143
5,43,interviewer,And is that... do you think it is something that is quite uniquely parkour is it a movement that you see in many other places?,98,25
5,44,participant,"I don't think so. I do think that it's something that kind of looks like parkour me like if I saw someone doing it out in the in the wilderness, I would definitely say like, oh, that person is doing parkour. Yeah, I would consider it you uniquely parkour.",198,49
5,45,interviewer,"Hmm. Yeah, I always, whenever I see it in TV or film or something, it always seems to be the movement that they go for, to show that they're doing parkour, this person can do parkour. Mm. So, just to just to rewind a little bit back to the movement itself, then. Could you kind of talk me through how the movement kind of breaks down? If that makes sense. So you know, what, what situations might use it in I suppose, might be a good a good place to start.",348,91
5,46,participant,"So I think, because this vault, obviously, you're going to use it with an obstacle that's probably between most often things something is like knee and chest height. And people do all sorts of variations on them, so double Kongs and everything to do obstacles that are wider, but you have sort of a moderately sized obstacle. People can often kong over it. And usually, like if you were coming in perpendicular and hoping to leave perpendicular to, if we're assuming like a wall, you would you might use a kong. Um. Because it is... it's sort of a straight line movement. Same ways, like a lazy, lazy vault, is this, this straight line movement, but parallel to a wall? That's sort of just 90 degree rotated. Are you asking me to describe the movement itself? Like how...",601,138
5,47,interviewer,"Yeah, like, if, if you were gonna, I guess if you're gonna coach it to someone, what would you... How would you kind of break it down for them?",105,29
5,48,participant,"Well, if I were coaching, I would demonstrate so they would have like, a thing, and then they would understand that a little bit better. But essentially, you would walk towards the obstacle and then either split step or punch to sort of jump into a hands down position and have your hips up, and then push off from the, you know, push off from your hands where your weight is, in order to rotate your shoulders up and your hips down, to get your feet through as you move over it so that you can land on your feet on the opposite side.",419,104
5,49,interviewer,"Just to check when you say punch thats, uh, kind of two foot together jump?",58,15
5,50,participant,"Yeah, like a two foot takeoff versus a one foot takeoff.",44,11
5,51,interviewer,Why would you use either one of those?,30,8
5,52,participant,"I think I would just specify either or because I think I've seen people do it both ways equally successfully. And I think sometimes when you're learning you watch the person who's doing the demonstration and say, okay, they're doing it that way. So I have to do it that way. But I'm more comfortable with a punch. And that took a long time for me to figure out like how to do it differently. But I do think it's important to know that like either takeoff can work.",362,89
5,53,interviewer,Do you think it makes a difference to the movement which one you use?,55,14
5,54,participant,"I think with a split step, you have the option of doing this sort of like kick behind you that can give you more momentum if you're having trouble getting your hips up. So depending on, you know what kind of troubleshooting we're doing how what problems a student is having getting over the obstacle, I might recommend one or the other. But if you're more comfortable with one and it just makes more sense for your body, then I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone from the punch.",383,87
5,55,interviewer,Okay.,4,1
5,56,participant,"I think it's a little more like, if you're first learning and you hit, like, when you first learn a movement, you can only think about so many things each time you go through, you sort of blank out in the middle of it and you end up on the other side, you're like what just happened. And so there's, you know, you don't want to overload them with information. And I think the punch is just a very simple you know, set of things to remember, you don't have to remember a lot, whereas the split step and adding the kick and adding the hips and everything, it's just it's just a little bit more to think about. So if it doesn't come naturally to the person the first time, um... you know, it's something I would add in later and not have that conversation right off the bat.",591,150
5,57,interviewer,So that might be more of a progression as they as they get more used to the movement.,67,18
5,58,participant,"Yeah, and I will say like, because it took me so long to learn to Kong, I was presented with many, many drills of how to work on different pieces of it. And so there are plenty of things that I would use as as progression pieces to the kong.",186,50
5,59,interviewer,Could you give me some examples?,26,6
5,60,participant,"Uh, yeah. So one of the things that so the pop on was a thing that we did a lot, a lot, a lot where you would approach the wall as if you're going to do a kong, put your hands down and then jump, do the, like hands to feet replacement, and put your hands down, or put your feet down where your hands were before. And then gradually try to move where your feet are landing from behind your hands to where your hands were in front of your hands. So eventually over the obstacle. So...",369,98
5,61,interviewer,"So, what was the, was there a, um, name that you used...",38,12
5,62,participant,[overlap] A pop on?,13,4
5,63,interviewer,...for that? Pop on? Okay. I like that.,25,8
5,64,participant,"[laugh] Slightly different from a pop, pop vault. But, um, yeah, so it was basically just this, like the Kong but without clearing obstacles. And I find most people, especially like younger adults are flexible enough to do that, if I was teaching like a 40 or 50 year old, sometimes it's difficult for them to like bend in the way to get their hands and feet in the same place. But typically, I would start with a pop on. I was also given one where you sort of start in like a downward dog position where your hands and your feet are both flat on the ground. And then you push off your hands here. So we stand like your weight is in your heels and you lean forward a sort of like rocking horse back and forth to get used to that push motion in your hands. Because it's not so much like an elbow push, a lot of it comes from your shoulders. And so working on like activating the sort of the shoulder push in addition, and I don't think that really had a name but...",748,190
5,65,interviewer,"Hmm. The, er, is the upper body important to the performance of the Kong, in that case? Or is it all from the takeoff...?",89,24
5,66,participant,"Yeah, it's definitely... definitely... it's definitely important in some ways, I think, to this day, part of why I don't use Kongs that often in my personal practice, and like I'm not still super comfortable with them is because something I'm doing with the push off in my arms doesn't feel strong enough. And unfortunately, I can't tell you whether that's a strength problem or a technique problem. But there's definitely like, your arms are definitely an active component of the movement.",384,82
5,67,interviewer,So are they... are they pushing you off the obstacle or are they just re-orientating your torso?,75,18
5,68,participant,"You know, I have heard it described as like, You're, you're pulling forward. So you're like to clear yourself over the obstacle. I have heard it described as pushing down on it so your shoulders can come up so your hips can sort of reorient themselves down below you sort of like pivot yourself around your, your horizontal axis. Or, like, you know, or just like getting your body out of the way so your feet have space to come under you. You know, I've sort of heard it described as having many different motives or like different directions to push in. But I think most commonly, it's like the scoop. It's like, it's just to get yourself past it.",505,120
5,69,interviewer,"So, I mean, you mentioned strength, is that, is that something that's important to the vault? Or is it flexibility? Cos I know you mentioned as well about being able to get the feet up to where the hands are in the pop on. Do you think one is more important than the other, do you think it ...kind of doesn't matter or...?",243,63
5,70,participant,"Um... you know, I've seen people that I don't think are super strong do Kongs before, I don't know. I'm trying to think of people who I know who aren't super flexible. I definitely know people who are not that flexible who can do Kongs as well. So I think you can honestly I think if you are very flexible or very strong, you can compensate and do sort of a sloppy Kong in either direction. But I think a lot of the movement is technique, you know, I think you shouldn't have to be super super flexible because ideally, you're not stretching up into that little ball like a good Kong has a little bit more space in it, it's a little bit more floaty so you have time to get your hands out of the way of your feet underneath. So I don't think you have to be super flexible. And I also don't think you have to be super strong. I think a lot of it is mental. And then a portion of it is obviously technical.",695,180
5,71,interviewer,"So the mental part, is that what you said about kind of letting go a little bit and being able to...",76,21
5,72,participant,"Yeah, I mean, I have just like many videos that people sent me of like me doing a Kong and they like trace over and they say like look, here's like your arms are straight up and down and like before you take them off the wall, they should be like a little bit further behind you or whatever. And I think just committing to letting myself drop over the edge when there was no limbs in front of my face was really hard for me.",332,86
5,73,interviewer,Mmm.,3,1
5,74,participant,"And just, yeah.",11,3
5,75,interviewer,"I know from from my own experience, the diving part was what was always kind of strange to me the idea of just throwing yourself forward in space.",117,28
5,76,participant,"Yeah, so I, I was a competitive swimmer before I came to parkour. So the the diving feeling is like the most comfortable part of the kong that's like something that's, that my body just like, I wouldn't have to think twice. And I feel like I can consistently dive in a fashion that would be safe and usable for my body. So I'm definitely like, an anomaly in that because of my past experience. But I didn't feel like the dive was hard for me. But I recognise that that's not everyone.",375,93
5,77,interviewer,"So it was the other side of the obstacle, that was the scarier part?",53,14
5,78,participant,"Yeah, it's like getting, getting over the top and coming down on the other side, for sure. Um, was definitely the difficult part.",100,23
5,79,interviewer,"So, um, so what, what kind of things are you looking for, or coaching or anything like that, for the, for once someone is over the obstacle? Are they are they landing... are you looking for them to just land and stop, or keep moving like what what kind of things happen... On the other side of the obstacle?",234,59
5,80,participant,"A lot of times, you'll see people do sort of like Kong pres, where they will try to stop in a very specific location. That's cool when they do it. But I think when I am coaching Kongs, or doing Kongs, I think it's in my mind, being able to continue moving out of it is like, like, a more functional piece if you're adding it to a route, and you're not just like coming to a standstill. In some ways, obviously, like there's some very, very difficult kong pres out there. But I do think that when I'm teaching it, I want people to be able to continue moving from it. Because I don't know, when it comes to a kong pre like you can always put like a precision trainer exactly where you land, and land a Kong pre every time. Whereas moving out of it and being able to decide where you're going, like, while you're mid air or keep continuing the movement, having the flow from it. I think that's a really like, useful thing to teach people. And then they can go and learn to do a kong pre in their own practice. But I think when I teach it in like a group setting, moving out of it fluidly is important.",842,217
5,81,interviewer,"Mm. What, what kind of thing would, um, would affect the ability to do that? And what would stop you from being able to move fluidly out of it?",109,29
5,82,participant,"So I think if you don't have a lot of control, like if you're sort of just hucking yourself over the obstacle, or you know, we sort of touched upon it with the flexibility thing. But if you don't have the space to control your descent, you might just like come down when you come down and your feet sort of like slam into the ground and you're, you know, you've functionally stopped your momentum wherever you are. So I think having the control to create space within your Kong dictates whether or not you can keep moving fluidly out of it. And because that space in that control is important to whether or not you're like, your Parkour is working. I would say that, you know, that's an important thing for people to work on.",569,136
5,83,interviewer,"Mmm. So you, are you trying to get people to land, um, it running, and to land on one foot and keep moving or still landing two feet that split. What kinds of things are happening?",138,36
5,84,participant,"[Not] sure, if there's a hard and fast rule, whether or not you can come out split foot versus at the, you know, landing at the same time. I certainly wouldn't draw a line there. I wouldn't say it wasn't a kong if you did one versus the other. But I think it depends on what you're doing next. Like if you're trying to do plyos after your kong and sort of do these, like, bounce off onto something else or, you know, change your direction, then maybe landing two feet makes more sense. But if you want to like if you want to run or stride from it then maybe landing one foot makes more sense. I think it is pretty much dictated by your environment and what movement you're trying to go into next.",536,136
5,85,interviewer,So it's very situational.,20,4
5,86,participant,Yeah.,4,1
5,87,interviewer,"Okay. But kind of like with the split for takeoff or punch takeoff. It's like, there's a few different variations, but they're all still a kong.",111,26
5,88,participant,"Yeah, well, I think I think the defining factor of the Kong is the like two hands down at the same time, and then hopping your feet over. And then if you want to get more specific about it, hopping your feet over in the same space where your your hands and arms were.",208,54
5,89,interviewer,"Okay. So that kind of bit over the obstacle is, is kind of the defining...",55,15
5,90,participant,Yeah...,4,1
5,91,interviewer,[overlap] ...Part.,11,2
5,92,participant,"...it's like what it looks like in the air. And I think part of that probably also comes from, like parkours lineage as an internet sport, where it was like a lot of people watching and copying, and not a lot of people like teaching for the first couple of decades. And so, you know, I think people probably like what it looks like in the air and what it looks like when it's photographed, is, has probably more... a bigger impact on whether or not it's a kong, than what it looks like, on the you know, the approach or the getaway.",408,103
5,93,interviewer,"It's a bit of a strange area to try and talk to people about because I've tried before and it can get a little abstract. But, you know, I think you mentioned earlier like the family of Kong movements. Do you feel like there is like, an iconic Kong? That is like, you know, when people say the word Kong, this is what comes to mind? Or do you think it's all just situational and open and people chop and change and they're all, they're all Kongs?",342,87
5,94,participant,"Yeah. I mean, if someone says Kong, I'm imagining they're going like they're taking off they're going two hands on the obstacle, they're moving the feet through as a, you know, described, I think within that family you have side Kongs, where your feet don't go where your arms were, but you also have ground Kongs, which are like the quadrupedal movement version of a Kong where you're on the ground, there's no obstacle and you're just sort of moving forward by doing this hands, feet, hands, feet hop. Or I dunno I think the the sort of hands feet pattern has a lot to do with whether or not it's categorised in the family of Kongs. But if someone says kong to me, I'm imagining the sort of the standard model where you see in movies where they like, tuck their feet up, and they push off their arms. Do that, I don't have like a specific video that I would link to and say like, this is the Kong but they're out there like they're that's how everyone does it. So I'm gonna guess perhaps your study isn't everyone doesn't do it that way. So...",804,197
5,95,interviewer,"Well, no, that's what I'm trying to find out. It's, it's really interesting talking about it with people because it seems to be something that almost becomes intrinsic, after you've done parkour for a while people go, Oh, yeah, you just Kong that. And you know what they mean? But no one's ever actually gone... This is a Kong vault, or this, isn't... It's a bit strange to think about, this kind of decentralised definition.",323,75
5,96,participant,"I also, I mean, I think it's worth noting that, like, I am part of what I think of as, like, an early generation of student coaches, like, my coaches didn't have coaches they are, they're self taught. Whereas like, I was, I learned parkour predominantly through taking lessons from people who knew how to do parkour. And we're all certified, to coach those movements, and parkour. And so I think, that definitely, like, changes my experience with learning it. For better or worse, but I do think there was someone who sat me down on one day and was like, Okay, today in class, we're gonna do kongs. And here's what it looks like, here are the pieces, which I think most of the people who are coaching at this point did not have, or, you know, some of the younger coaches did have, but many of the coaches in the sort of, like, late 20s, into their 30s range right now are all pretty much self taught. And so there might be more variations within that group on how they sort of define it. I would guess, I don't know.",780,192
5,97,interviewer,"So when it comes to, to the Kong in that case... What are the kinds of the things, particularly if you're coaching it, perhaps, that you kind of take as, um, signs of success in the movement? What makes a good kong versus a bad kong? I know you mentioned space a little bit earlier, but... ",218,56
5,98,participant,"Yeah. So I think like, there's obviously like, the fundamental pieces of like, putting your hands down in the right place, getting your feet, like clearing the obstacle, all of that, like the first mark of success is just like having the pieces in the right order, and going where you want to go with them. I think that's a big part for a lot of people and particularly, like, when you teach these in class, that's like the sticking point because, like, if you're if you're learning it on your own, you can do it until it works for your body. Whereas if you're in a class, you have like 10 tries, you're in a rotation with other people. You can't stand around and think about it, there's like a time limit, and you either like, already can do it or you're not gonna be able to do it today, I think a Kong very much is something that you have to go and do your homework for. You can't learn it in class, you have to go out and figure out how it works for your body. Or maybe you don't, because it already works for your body, maybe, you know, there's some people who it's very intuitive to and they can just do it. Um. And so I think that's the first like, like, the first breakdown is like whether or not you can clear the obstacle whether or not like the pieces all are there. I think you can have success before you do that, like doing clean pop ons, sometimes people have a lot of trouble getting their feet to land exactly where their hands were, um, their feet are a lot behind their hands. So like an early, you know, success, because I don't want success to only be can you do the vault, right? When you're learning, you have to have points of success that happened before success at the very end. Because otherwise it's very frustrating, discouraging. And so whether or not you're you're getting your hands to replace your feet, I think that success on the side of not clearing the obstacle. But I think there's success, there's like even further versions of success beyond clearing the obstacle. And obviously, that's like how like clean and floaty it is if your hips are super high, then maybe you can transition to a double kong, if that's what you're interested in, or, you know, you have control exiting it because you have you know, enough push in your hands that you're you're really getting your chest up. And so then you can transition to kong pres that are, you know, in different directions or farther than, um, farther than you're jumping before. So I think I would, I would put points of success out cautiously sort of draw a line of whether you're clearing the obstacle or not, and then put various points of success on either side of it. Because I think there's always there's always something more cool that you can do. And there's also always, you know, improvement that can be made before you've sort of reached the like, the success point.",2226,533
5,99,interviewer,"So thinking perhaps, as well as more like experienced practitioners, so not just beginners. You know, you mentioned distance there, is that something that people work on? Is that is that important to the movement, being able to travel farther over the front, once you exit the movement?",230,48
5,100,participant,"I feel like you're framing these questions as like, is this important? And it like, I just would like to make it clear that I don't think any of it's important, in some ways. Like, I think if you are interested in doing it, it's important if it's something that like, you feel fulfilled by working on, it's important if it's, if it's a part of your practice, it's important. But like, if I don't ever care about doing a kong pre then like it's not important. If I don't learn, I'm still a practitioner, people still, you know, can do other really cool things. Just because you can't do a kong pre doesn't mean you can't flip doesn't mean you can't train at height or you can't rail balance or any of these other things that are all also important parts of our practice.",586,145
5,101,interviewer,"I mean, I completely agree. Like it's... I guess it's from a, from a coaching point of view. ",66,18
5,102,participant,Yeah. So...,6,2
5,103,interviewer,"If you're gonna do Kongs in class, what might you work on? I guess is maybe a better way of putting it.",78,22
5,104,participant,"Okay. So I think I mean, the vast majority of people that I'm working on Kongs with are it's, it's early on in their sort of exposure to Kongs. So they're not at the point where we're doing like, Kong to rail pres, or they're not doing like, you know, sort of more advanced versions of the movement in my sort of wider training community where we like, are all going out and like having a jam on a Saturday afternoon. Yeah, kong pres are like super popular. The, the distance that you're sort of kong pre-ing out of, is definitely something you'll see people working on, like if there's, you know, a specific and again, it's like, obviously, with so much in parkour, it's location specific, where if there's something cool that they think they can maybe get to after a kong, for sure, they're going to spend two hours like trying to get to it. But that's less of like a coach thing, like you're trying to get there. And it's more people who know their bodies and know, like, what they've done in the past and say like, Oh, yeah, well, this is like this is close enough that I think I can make it here within today's session.",860,213
5,105,interviewer,So I guess maybe would a better way to put it be that success is perhaps more just whether the individual achieves what they want to do in that environment? At that time? Is that a good way to put it like...,161,42
5,106,participant,"Yeah, I mean, because I think it really like... I think... A more useful version of this conversation has to do with like, or like takes into account, the level of the practitioner like if they're new success might just be getting over it, or if they're [old] success might just be getting on top of it. Or if they're, you know, if they've been training for a long time success might be nailing that rail pre that's like super far or like, finally thing like a double Kong or something like that. But I think it is, it's very dependent on, obviously, where someone is in their, in their practice. And so I... I know that I'm not like giving you a, an answer that's like really makes that much sense. But I do think it's like, so important to that conversation, like taking into account where a person is and having markers of success along the way, because, like, the people who were coaching me and tried to get me to do a Kong, all they cared about was me getting over the obstacle. And like I was struggling so hard to get over it. And it was such a frustrating, and like, discouraging experience because like I just couldn't hit that mark of success. And there was not a lot of like, okay, here are other things that like you can work on along the way, and you can get good at and have success in. And ultimately like that will turn into the conflict. I never, at any point of the three months felt like I was making progress. You know, it always felt like I'm just throwing myself at this. I'm trying to listen to people's suggestions, but like nothing is, is giving me better perspective. And I think, I don't know, I still suspect. And I don't have any data to back this up. But I still suspect that part of that is because I have a very different body than people who are coaching me. And so...",1385,344
5,107,interviewer,"How does that make a difference to the performance of the movement? Is it, uh I dunno, easier for tall people? Like what what kinds of things you think make a difference for the, for the movement?",154,37
5,108,participant,"So we we talk about like your ape index, which is like how long your arms are in comparison to the rest of your body. And so like, if you have really long arms, you have more, you should have intrinsically more space below you when you're doing a Kong. And it means you don't have to get your hips up as high, you don't have to have all of the different like, perfectly very, balanced variables. To clear the obstacle, it's just like you have more space to do it. I also think that like, I am quite small. And one thing that I run into all the time is our vault boxes are designed by people who are six feet tall, and also have been training for 15 years, and they look very approachable to them. And to me, you know, they're they're 20% larger than they are for anyone else. And so it's definitely much harder to learn at max power than like a medium power level. And for me, there's no other option than to try it at max power. Or else like going outside and finding a concrete wall, which like, has its own intimidation factors, because people are watching you. And because, you know, there's hard ground on either side of it and all of that. And so, for me, a large part of like making it work was finding an environment that was designed for me like that made more sense for my body. And I think it happens a lot of people in particular, we're like, the space is designed for the sort of traditional parkour practitioner and like, the rest of us sort of muddle through as best as we can. But also, like, I, again, I'd like don't have any science to back this up, but like, my hips are a lot wider, whereas like, they carry a lot more of their weight, neck, shoulders, and so like getting my hips up, and like having the arm strength there to like, push from your shoulders. It's just a different experience, I think. And my hips are like, because my hips are wider than theirs, like them, having their hands at shoulder width is different from me having my hands at shoulder width, or them telling me to like, you know, like, swing my like, in an L sit, right where you're like, they're my hips are like wide enough that my, my arms should be kind of where my hips are where the guys like their arms are straight down. And it's just, I'm... I am just balanced differently enough that some other suggestions, or the things that work for them don't quite make as much sense for my body. And it took a lot of time with, like, figuring out how like, just on my own without input from them. I'm trying to make sense of what pieces of that advice I needed to discard. And I think I mean, that's that's a huge part of why I became a coach, right? Because like, there weren't female coaches in my community. And I thought it was just like, it was not fair. And so you know, I mean, I don't like I don't like to say this is fair. This is not fair. It's not like, you know, who knows what fair is but, like, at the end of the day, I felt like the women in our community were being underserved and in a certain way, because they're like people with their experiences weren't represented on our coaching staff and like not represented in who was designing our equipment and, and all of that. And so now I've gone off and like feminism tangent, but I do think it's like the way the way your body is balanced, definitely changes the way you move sometimes.",2573,647
5,109,interviewer,"Mm. I do find that really interesting what you said about like the distribution of weight between the hips and the shoulders. I find that really interesting. Because one of the things that I'm kind of interested in is the, the biomechanics of the Kong vault. That's actually something really worth I think, investigating.",259,54
5,110,participant,"Yeah. So there's a video I'm sure you seen, like from from the YouTube channel parkour science, where they talk about the girl role. And about how essentially, like, if your hips are, your centre of mass is lower, you should be rolling in a different way, because the regular roll doesn't protect you. And I have like friends who went to MIT and like, studied biomechanics. And so I like, spent several months with them trying to like figure out if the science behind this video is sound, and if whatever. And ultimately, like, they decided it was like a maybe but like not super conclusively. But it's a hard thing to study. And I think like, people have tried before, but I'm always like, cau-... cautious to preface by like, this is anecdotal experience. This is like how I feel about my body. But like, it's a hard thing to study. I've [laugh] I wish you luck.",665,159
5,111,interviewer,"[laugh] Thank you. It's, it's interesting, because the first place my mind kind of goes is where you're also talking about the height of the obstacles. And obviously, the higher the obstacle, the more effort it's going to take to get hips up. So it's like a double whammy, two for one, in terms of making it harder for you.",247,60
5,112,participant,"Yeah. And then whenever, like, I'd be like, Okay, well, let's, you know, we have like tires in our gym that like have have flat tops on them. So we would like, sometimes stack them and be like, okay, like, Can you kong off this, and then the guys would come over to me and be like, you can't kong on that, like, it's too low, it's way more difficult to kong on something low. It's like, okay, but like, it's, it's too low for you. But like, what you're like, you just aren't, you see the world through different eyes than I do, right? Like, you're just, you know, and like, I need something a little bit lower to learn on. I don't know, I think it's, it's a thing that I didn't even notice I went to, to visit a gym, like a couple communities away. And it's run by a husband and wife, couple, and the wife is about my height. And I was like, Oh my god, like, every everything that I thought I couldn't do, every vault that I've ever struggled with, is suddenly working on this day that I visited that gym. And at the end, I realised that was because they're vault boxes were like a little bit smaller. And I came back home and I was like, talking very excitedly with the other, the other coaches, and I was like, wow, like, everything suddenly makes a lot more sense on these lower boxes. And the guy who like owns the gym up here was like, Oh, we do have lower boxes, there at the middle schools, where we teach kids classes, you can go sign up for one of those. And I was like, you know, it was obviously a joke and, like, we all laughed about it. But like, in my heart, it was like, he was saying, like, this space isn't for you. Because you're small and a woman like, we didn't build this for you and like, suck it up, you know? And so... I do think that like, in all of our, our sort of our science and our industry, in our conversations about parkour, there's this like, intrinsic, like, built in lack of women's perspectives, and a lot of this stuff is like, very frustrating for me to like, especially at this moment, right now we're like... and sorry, I'm getting way away from kongs [laugh]",1568,409
5,113,interviewer,[laugh] It's okay.,12,3
5,114,participant,"Especially in this moment, right now where like, parkour businesses are like, our, it feels like finally really starting to put roots in and become established in the parkour like, you know, being on TV in America, we finally have world chase tag, and like, you know, all of these things like it feels like we're finally starting to put down roots, but we're putting down those roots without the perspectives of people within the community that, like, will... We're building in systemic barriers that we don't have to build in. And so like, I don't know, just it's just frustrating to watch. And obviously, I know we have to build those things quickly, because there are all sorts of external threats trying to build them for us and not do a good job serving our communities until like, I respect that. But I also want women's voices to be represented in those spaces. [pause]",688,155
5,115,interviewer,"Do you think that, um... Just to come back to the kong vault a little bit, is it... [laugh] Sorry, it's the title of my study, I have to try. Um...",100,31
5,116,participant,[laugh] Of course.,13,3
5,117,interviewer,"Is it something that is, you find common for women to learn, er, hard to learn? Do you think it's on, depends on the individual?",97,25
5,118,participant,"I do think it depends on the individual, because I definitely know women who cannot Kong and like really struggle as much as I do. But I have known plenty of women who have come into one of my sessions and been like, I've never done parkour before but I want to learn something parkour-y, and I've been like great, let's try Kong vault. And within an hour, they've been just fine doing it. So it's hard, it's hard for me to say whether or not women struggle with it. Because I also think that like, teaching from a woman's perspective, like I might teach it slightly differently. And so it might be hard for people to learn, but it might also be hard for them to learn because, because they're learning from people with a different experience in them. But then again, like also plenty of women are, you know, very slim, or have narrow hips or, you know, are not built the way I'm built. And so it's hard to make a blanket statement, you know, and say it's like, either harder or easier for them.",769,189
5,119,interviewer,"It's um... it's funny you say about a blanket statement, because that seems to be what I am coming up against quite a bit in this study is that... it's very individual. Is that, is that fair to say?",147,39
5,120,participant,[overlap] Yeah.,11,2
5,121,interviewer,"[overlap] Like, the movement as a whole.",30,7
5,122,participant,"Yes, I mean, I think there are certainly standardised pieces of the Kong but whether or not you want to use it, and how difficult it is to learn and how you do it definitely, like, there is a personal element of it. There's a personal style one in anything in parkour, but there's also, you know, like, technical aids that people use, whether that's, you know, you're not super flexible, so you're stronger, and you sort of muddle your way through it, or, you know, there's just people do it in the way that makes sense for their body. I think.",417,102
5,123,interviewer,I suppose the thing I'm trying to find out then really is what what are the standardised parts? You know?,83,20
5,124,participant,[unclear],7,1
5,125,interviewer,"-consider... Sorry, go on.",17,4
5,126,participant,"I think I would, I would put sort of the the, once your feet leave the ground to once your feet leave the ground on the opposite side, like that whole portion in the air feels like you can sort of distil that to a like an ideal version of that, I think coming into it or coming out of it. There's like variations depending on your, the space that you're doing it in. But once you're, you know, once you leave the ground, I think the pattern of like two hands in the middle. Um, and I know I've just like saying this over and over again. But like two hands in the middle, hips up, push off with your hands, and then like feet forwards to get you, get them back under you.",514,135
5,127,interviewer,And the kind of... the kind of ability to come out of that with control and connect into whatever you want to do next is kind of the thing that you're aiming for there?,130,34
5,128,participant,"Yeah, I mean, I think if you're trying to do like a good Kong, if you're trying to make it look nice, obviously, you want to have control, you want to have space in that you don't want to look like you're just like kind of curling up into a ball and hopping over it. Which you see a lot of people who don't have the sort of strength or the confidence to dive into it. Yeah, like, the, the more space and the more control you can have in it, the prettier it's gonna look. And if you're, if you're shooting for a pretty Kong, then like, that's what you want. But then like, there are a lot of people who just want power in their kong like that, like if you're in World chase tag and you're trying to kong over something you just want to be fast, right? You just want to get away from someone else. And so I think if you try to distil it into like what the goals are there, then you also run into problems because there's so many people use parkour for so many different things. There are a lot of people in our community who just like you like a spin class, you know, they go they get their exercise and they go home, it's not part of their like, lifestyle. It's not part of their like, don't go out training on their own or like hanging out with parkour people as friends. It's just like, purely fitness based and for them doesn't even matter if they clear the obstacle, right? Like just the jumping like is getting the tone in their butt that they want, you know, like there's the I think you can't get too specific with the goals. Because again, there's, there's just like so, so many things that people want to get out of Parkour and parkour has so much to offer that. You know, you can't just say that that, oh, you know, everybody wants this from it because there's so much. Parkour has so much going on.",1386,353
5,129,interviewer,"I guess my question then is, we may have already talked about this a little bit, is, as, when it comes to coaching it. Obviously, it's very individual. But as a coach, there has to be some, you know, you're doing if you're delivering to 20 people, there's some there's something you're trying to get across. Right. So what is it just being able to clear the obstacle in that case, that's the priority that you're kind of working on?",330,80
5,130,participant,"Yeah, I mean, I think part of being a good parkour coach is to, like, work with whoever's in your class on that day. And so like, my, my goal, as a coach on that day might be to get as many people over the obstacle as can do it on that day, but also to continue challenging the people who can do it easily. And also give successful options, you know, an options for success for people who can't clear the obstacle. And so I think, yeah, the, the first thing I would say is like, getting people over the obstacle, following the pattern of what makes it look like a kong is like, it's sort of number one, but also, there gonna be some people who can already do it. And so giving them like a precision trainer on the other side to shoot for, or, you know, like another vault box, and they decide to like kong in and go straight into another movement, maybe like a plyo in there or something. Um. You know, you then can build out your environment to give people other things to do. Or you can scale it back and say, okay, like, if you can't get over the obstacle, doing these pop ons, or doing this, like rocking horse motion to get used to the pushing your shoulders. You know, I don't think... I think as a coach... and as a good coach, you have to be prepared to interact with students who can both do it and not do it already. But I think the goal is to get people over the obstacle, and then they can work on whether they want to do, you know, a floatier version of it, or a precision afterwards, or any of those pieces, those I think, are sort of, like more technical add ons. But like, for me, just getting people over the obstacle in the pattern is sort of the the first bit because I work with, you know, more beginner level students.",1332,342
5,131,interviewer,"I really like that. Um. The idea of the add on. It's a nice way of thinking about it. I'm aware of the time. So we, um, I don't want to...",95,31
5,132,participant,"I'm not in any rush, so-",16,6
5,133,interviewer,"I don't want to monopolise your day. I guess really just kind of... just to finish up, is there anything, either just as a practitioner or coach or anything like that, anything about the Kong vault that you kind of want to find out or anything that any questions you have about for yourself? Or? It's okay, if the answer's no, for this one. It's just I'm curious if there's anything that people are like, I want to know whether this makes a difference, or I should do this or...",366,90
5,134,participant,"Yeah, I mean, there's... I mean, there's so much that, you know, you could wonder about and especially because of all of the problems I had, there's like, there's a lot of things that I want to know, like a lot of advice that was given to me that I want to know, well, was that really true? Like was that actually like something I should have been thinking about more what would have helped me to be able to do that thing they were recommending. But sort of at this point, in my training, the thing that like is most important to me is like, like, how, how much does your centre of mass change how you do this motion, like, because I work with women, and because I am woman shaped, like do I need to be offering like, adjusted advice from the advice that was given to me by the men who taught me, um, are some of the things that I just parrot because they were told to me, not necessarily useful to the people that I am parroting them to. So, you know, and then that centre of mass distribution, but it's also like, I hear people say all the time, like, oh, put your feet, like hip width apart. And hip width for women and hip width for men is like, oftentimes different. And so like, you know, it's like, we create all of these little, little pieces in how we jump that we talk about it in this way, or, you know, we use this vocabulary to describe it. And I guess, I would just want to know, like, is it as useful to half of the population, you know, obviously, not half the population, but maybe we would have an easier time recruiting and retaining women into our sport. If we were better about it. Talking about how to train them, or if we were better about, you know, talking about their movements. And so I guess my big question would just be like, Is it different for people who were, you know, balanced, who tend to be balanced in this way versus people who tend to be balanced in that way. But then it's because you're factoring in like, height, centre of mass, like, width of shoulders, and hips, and all of that other stuff. So that's like a big other project [laugh]",1594,402
5,135,interviewer,"But I mean, that that's the kind of stuff that I hope to move towards. I mean, this study is, um, kind of a factfinding thing to start feeding into that stuff. Because the thing that I didn't want to happen is to start running down that road of investigating stuff, with numbers and measurements and all that stuff and actually have then the parkour community turn around and go, we're not interested in any of that, or something like that. So. And also, I think what's really interesting is... the idea of the kind of conventional wisdom that's just kind of sprung up around parkour, just because it's been passed on word of mouth. And, and as you as you say, is that correct? Or is it... Should we actually be saying to our students, do it this way instead? So I think those are some really important points to kind of talk about.",646,155
5,136,participant,"I think maybe simplifying it to one gender neutral question is like, where do your hips needs to be? Because people were always telling me get your hips or your hips higher, but they were the same people I'd see do Kongs with their hips, not ever getting higher than their head, you know, anything, there's a big fear factor and getting your hips up, because suddenly you have the ability to like, tip in directions that like, you know, you lose stability, the higher your hips get. And so I think that's it, that was a big thing for me, it was like, just like, how high do they actually need to be? Plenty of people do them very well without getting their hips up. [laughs] That's my like, one really specific piece of it.",561,136
5,137,interviewer,"No no, it's great. It's definitely something that... immediately my brain is like, yeah, because that makes sense. Because if you're, if you're stronger, or you know more, your weight, it's more distributed towards your shoulders, perhaps you don't need to get the hips up as much because you can push off the obstacle higher and create more space for yourself.",281,61
5,138,participant,"This helps as well, especially like your hips are probably lighter, comparatively. Whereas like, if you if your centre of mass is lower, and your hips are heavier, comparatively, both getting your hips up. Like if your centre of mass and your shoulders and your hands are planted firmly, you don't really have to worry about like your stability is okay. versus if your centre of mass is lower your stability suddenly, like tips funny and it's like much scarier I, I suspect. I think that's one of the problems I was having with like, the mental side of it was that I felt there was like no stability in that moment where you know, my hips were higher. Anyways.",521,120
5,139,interviewer,"That's good. Well, give me a couple of years and hopefully once all this lockdown stuff is finished, and I can actually get in a lab and give you an answer.",121,31
5,140,participant,[unclear],7,1
5,141,interviewer,"So I think that will, will do for today. Thank you very much for your time.",57,16
5,142,participant,Of course.,8,2
5,143,interviewer,Much appreciated. I'll stop the recording. Is there anything else you wanted to just add? Or?,73,16
5,144,participant,"I don't think so. I mean, I guess, like, news, like beating a dead horse, but if you can talk to like, women, when you're doing your study, I think it's an important part of like, having accurate data is like just as many people with as many different body types, you know, not just women, but you know, people were all sorts of shapes. I know they're hard to find, but [laughs]",284,73
5,145,interviewer,"Yeah, I've tried to reach out to as many as I can.",36,12
5,146,participant,Yeah.,4,1
5,147,interviewer,"If there's anyone that you know, that you think might be interested, please do pass the details on to them as well. But yeah, it is difficult, unfortunately.",123,28
5,148,participant,"No, it is. I know, I'm like I'm always telling people like oh, like, you know, you shouldn't you should try to involve women. That's like, why don't you have any women coaches at this event? Because there aren't any. Like, I totally get it. But I have to, I have to recommend it anyways.",213,55
5,149,interviewer,Yeah. Absolutely. All right. Cool. I'll stop the recording in that case.,55,12
6,1,interviewer,"Alright, there we go. Alright. So I guess the place I've been kind of starting these with people is just to little to explain a little bit about the study and the goals. There's a little bit about it in the information sheet. But just to say that I'm kind of trying to talk to people parkour coaches in particular about how they understand the parkour techniques that have kind of evolved over time. Because it's kind of a decentralised sport. It doesn't have like a central rulebook or guideline or governing body or anything at the moment. It's just kind of grown organically. So I'm interested how people kind of understand these organically developed movements, right. And I pick the Kong vault just as kind of like, a well known movement to start with. So I guess the first thing to kind of check with you is like, is, is the term Kong vault, one that you recognise is that the word the the term that you use? Do you know it as something else?",748,176
6,2,participant,"Yeah, Kong vault or catpass, interchangeably? And then there's some people call it stuff like the King Kong vault, but that's, nah. Kong or catpass.",115,25
6,3,interviewer,"Okay. Is there is the one or the other, do you tend to find yourself using? Or does it not really matter?",80,22
6,4,participant,"It doesn't really matter? It depends on who I'm with because different people have different phrases, and I'm just sort of whatever helps the most people and we both understand. When I'm coaching, I use Kong. That's probably most important to the study. I use kong for that.",215,48
6,5,interviewer,"Okay. And you might not know, do you know, perhaps where you maybe first heard that term?",69,17
6,6,participant,"Yeah, YouTube. The Tapp Brothers and Ronnie Street Stunts [laughs] Classics.",61,11
6,7,interviewer,"And I guess, how would you just how would you describe the movement? If you're going to put it into words?",82,21
6,8,participant,"Yeah, so it's, you're trying to get over a wall quickly, to very simply , you run up up to a wall, put your hands on the wall, sort of push yourself over, and bring your feet through your hands, so that you land on the other side?",172,47
6,9,interviewer,"Okay, so is it just to try and get like some more detail for that? Is it two hands at the same time? Is it one hand then the other? Like...",102,31
6,10,participant,"Yeah okay, I'll break it down like fully then, see you come into it, and you've got two techniques for takeoff, you've either got just the split foot, which is the most common, so like a one to almost like a into like a gallop, or a hurdle, that's going to propel you off the ground. Or, there's the word that I can't remember. But it's basically a two footed jump. So you're almost like diving into it. Um, just before, then, you've got the dip as well. So you want to have your eyes, like, level with the wall and two foot takeoff, plant both hands at the same time. And they're going to be pretty much in line with your eyes, you're then going to use this sort of push, to push yourself up. And as your feet sort of get, as your toes are about to touch the edge of the wall, you push off of your hands to sort of like Naruto run through the air,  bring your feet like through that gap that was created by your hands. And then as you come off, you're still you push and you bring your chest up, your feet come down and you basically land in like a rolling position.",812,212
6,11,interviewer,"Okay. Is is that, like a description that you just kind of thought up just now? Or is that something that you, you, kind of would have ready to go for a class or something, is it...",136,37
6,12,participant,"There's a couple like key elements in there that I use a lot when I'm teaching. It's quite odd doing this over Zoom, because like I feel when I'm coaching it's so important to show. And especially like for parkour, and as someone who's always learned through like seeing and then trying, it's much easier but yeah, so I'd like the key bits, I'm always like, you got to start with a dip, because if you're above the wall, you're going to find it so hard to pop your feet through. And so dip is the first step. The takeoff is the second step. It's not too important in like the early stages, so long as like they're getting over the wall I'm not fussed whether it's a two foot takeoff or split foot takeoff, that's fine. Um, planting in the hands. And that weird sort of like pull-push movement is very important. And yeah, getting their feet up to the wall. If I was like teaching that I break it down so like, let's start with a dip or get 'em used to just pushing up and not even like taking their feet off the ground. Then from like a standing position, and get 'em used to just pushing up and jumping to like getting their feet on the wall, and depending on the width of the wall, trying to get them more and more forwards, if they're struggling with that, you can do it on the floor as well. So I'll put like a line on the floor, and I'll say right, put your hands here. You know, you're almost in like a crawl position, put your hands here and pull through, and you want to try and get your feet over this line. And then you take it back to the wall. And then yeah, from the wall, just getting used to just dropping off. And then let's slowly put it together. So dip, jump up onto the wall, move your feet. Keep doing that until your feet further and further forward until they just, clear.",1376,350
6,13,interviewer,"That's a great description. I agree. It's, it's kind of weird. Because it it's usually a very visual thing.",80,19
6,14,participant,Yeah.,4,1
6,15,interviewer,"What, what's, what's important about the dip, part? What does that contribute?",60,12
6,16,participant,"I think it's so important to lower like, your chest is where a lot of the movement comes from. It's the dip, powering upwards of that. And I don't know too much about centres of gravity. But I imagine that's going to do a bit. But the point is, it's by lowering yourself almost like a spring, you can then go back up, its the same reason like it's you get a better jump, if you bend your legs, and then jump up rather than just jumping from standing. So yeah you get that dip. And then it's sort of easier to hurl yourself over the wall, almost in an arc, you're down to come up.",440,116
6,17,interviewer,"And you mentioned as well, the two main types of takeoff. With the split foot one, I think you said being more common.",92,23
6,18,participant,Yeah.,4,1
6,19,interviewer,Does it make a difference which one you use?,35,9
6,20,participant,"At the start, like when I'm teaching, I tend to just like I said, Get the feet over the wall. And what you tend to see or I tend to see with like beginners, including myself, is that the punch technique, which is the two foot, just punching two feet into the ground and going, is easier because people are more familiar with it, they don't have to think about, oh, I'm going left foot right foot, takeoff. But as you develop, and if you want to like continue your practice, and especially if you want to focus on things like, like flowing into it, not just having it as one isolated moment, if you want to be able to run into it, I find a split foot's really, really useful. And it's why a lot of like advanced practitioners use that because it's more flexible, especially if you can do both sides. So if you can only do left foot right foot, takeoff, if you ever run into it, and you've only got enough space for two steps into the wall, and that's going to be right foot left, what you're going to have to hop which is going to look really weird. Or you're going to have to punch, which is not as smooth, or you just have to give up and start again [unclear] I think it's a matter of preference. I think in the wider community like the split foot is looked upon more favourably, just because of the benefits it offers in terms of like flow, and like connecting it together. And you know, not having to stop that punch in the name of efficiency. With a, when I'm coaching especially when I'm coaching kids, and especially when they've not done it before. I'm not fussed, they get over the wall, and I'll teach them the split foot later, I learned with the punch in and learnt the split foot so. Think it's fine. It doesn't make too much difference.",1348,335
6,21,interviewer,"And so when you're, when you're actually coming to the obstacle itself, I mean, it's obviously difficult to say because these things are very, it could be a huge number of reasons you might use it but are there like particular types of obstacles its more commonly used on or situations it's more commonly used in?",249,56
6,22,participant,"Yeah. In terms of surfaces, walls rather than handrails, just because it feels more comfortable to have your hands flat on the wall rather than gripping rounds and thin and then sort of pulling yourself. And so generally walls [unclear] outs and rather than just being like... it often goes into like a pre or like you're trying to take off somewhere and land on another surface that isn't just the ground, like a raised surface. Um... yeah, and obviously there's variations like double Kongs, dive kongs, Kong gainers, all this jazz, kong fronts as well but in it's like simplest its just doing a kong. I think rather than just... it's either to get a bunch of power to go really fast and just throw yourself over it. Or it's to sort of have a controlled takeoff where your feet are going very forward so you can land very nicely in a pre.",656,154
6,23,interviewer,"So is that, is there something about the movement that you think on the other side lends itself to, to doing a precision, is it? ",100,25
6,24,participant,Yeah-,4,1
6,25,interviewer,Maybe compared to some other vaults or?,32,7
6,26,participant,"Yeah, I think they obviously a lot of vaults can lead to pres. But I think the kong is the most favoured one, at least I found because it generates a lot of power. So you can get a good amount of distance, you're not going to, I mean, obviously, it depends wall to wall, but like, I don't know, honestly, standard, that's not a thing. There's no such thing as a standard kong pre. Um... [overlap] It generates a lot of power.",318,83
6,27,interviewer,"[overlap] I know what you mean, it's difficult, which is one of the reasons I'm trying to talk to people is like, there, there isn't really like, ""the"" Kong vault. There's a lot of things. But just talking in terms of like, common things or, or typical cases, I guess.",200,50
6,28,participant,"I think unlike vaults, perhaps like the lazy vault or the step vault, it's easier to change how much power you're generating. So it's very easy to kong and go over the wall and almost land with your heels on the side of that wall. And it's not a technique that's used very often, but it's, you know, you can stand and just launch yourself over. Um, but you could also generate a lot of distance and a lot of height. And it's you know, and you can change that depending on how much you dip, how much you pull, how much you like punch, how much speed you go into it with. So in terms of like how different every environment is, it's very flexible. In terms of what the actual, like precision movement, you come into it and your eyes, as soon as they go over that wall, you're going to spot what you're going to land on, your feet are then going to come through and they're going to be extended like so they're going to be here, you're heads here. And they're going to come through, they're going to be extended in front of you. And for me, um, that's how you want to do a pre, you want to see your feet extended out in front of you, your legs extended out in front of you like this, so that you know ah yeah, my toes are gonna go there, I'm gonna land perfectly. And that bringing the legs through from behind, and coming through and like pushing forwards sets yourself perfectly up to just go [gestures] and get that really nice stick.",1102,278
6,29,interviewer,"Do the, so you've mentioned the kind of push-pull on the wall, or the obstacle, do the arms like contribute a lot to the movement or are they just like, touching?",125,32
6,30,participant,"Yeah, no, definitely. So again, like how much force you put into that movement where you put your hands in the wall and like you sort of... when you're doing the dip, you're almost pulling yourself forward, but as soon as you clear that wall to push, is the Naruto arms, the only way I've ever found to describe that. But it works. And yeah, the hands. Yeah. Yeah, you're generating a huge amount of power, how far you can get forward. It's like based on that like, push away like movement. Um... And yeah, it separates it from just like hurdling. You're dipping and you're generating that power to go upwards. And I don't know, it'll be weird to do without hands. It would just be like a box jump.",529,131
6,31,interviewer,"Yes. Do you, um, do you consider it like a fundamental movement for people to learn when they're learning parkour, is it an important part...",109,25
6,32,participant,"100%. Yeah, yeah. 100%. Because like I say it leads on to so many other options. So you've got your standard Kong over the wall. You can do kong pres. You can go on to dive Kongs, which then develop into double Kongs, um, if you want to do some like tricking flipping stuff, you got Kong gainers, kong fronts. And, and then just as a move for like climbing as well like if you want to quickly get on top of something that doesn't require necessarily a whole like climb up, but it doesn't require full extension like if it's about probably about like chest height. Like you can pretty much just jump on and like pop with the Kong motion onto the wall. And even if it's a little bit higher that you can put your foot on as if you're doing a wall run. And rather than end up in cat hang into climb up, you can just pop straight up. I think it's there's not really like a general name for it but I have always just known it as like the pop up, or the top out or the pop vault, yeah. And, and that's all at the foundation of that is in the kong. Like I was saying about doing it on the floor as well, like quadrupedal movement. You start with the Kong. Like you can do, one of my friends calls them ape crawls, where just like jump forward and like pounce you know two hands, two feet, two hands, two feet. And, and even like, I don't know why like I think people are preferring it aesthetically over like rolls at the minute is that you don't land and go into a roll-",1122,292
6,33,interviewer,For landing?,10,2
6,34,participant,"Yeah, so you land and almost like shuffle like you do a kong to the side. [unclear] And then like pull up. Again, I don't know exactly why that is, but I think it's mostly an aesthetic thing. And mostly I think it feels quicker. Like you hit the floor, you tap and you're straight up. But yeah, the Kongs like sort of a fundamental movement. I think if you look back to the sort of animals that parkour has always been inspired by look at monkeys and cats and lemurs. It's all about being on all fours. That's all about that. Like pouncing motion. Like cat motion on King Kong monkey style motion. So yeah, having it's a foundation of any, any movement. Yeah.",507,125
6,35,interviewer,"Is it something that you think is pretty unique to parkour as well? In terms of sport, maybe?",73,18
6,36,participant,"Yeah. Yeah, I think so. I have the, I spoke briefly about hurdles before. They're very deliberately not using the hands. I guess obstacle course race, racing, you could use it, but it's not really a, it's not an obstacle course technique. It's a parkour technique. And I know there's things like [name] at the minute which claims it's nothing to do with parkour but is definitely to do with parkour. They use like, Kong motions and claim you know, is it's it's an animalistic, primal movement. So even when this movement does sort of, like permeate into other parts of sports, like movement practices, its foundations is in parkour. Yeah.",496,111
6,37,interviewer,"Is it quite a, like, iconic parkour movement as well? Is it like",49,13
6,38,participant,100%.,3,1
6,39,interviewer,Yeah.,4,1
6,40,participant,"100%. Yeah. I mean, as soon as you say kong, like, I can't help but think of Imax in London, because, you know, it's just crazy, like Kongs everywhere. Yeah, I'd say it's like the, the parkour movement if someone were like oh what's the movement that you feel most defines parkour, I'd be like, the Kong vault because it's efficient. It does what it needs to do. It requires like a level of agility, and like, mental focus as well. And, and it leads to so many other things. Like, like, I've listed them off before, so I won't do it again. It's such a fundamental movement. Yeah, I'd say it's the, ""the"" parkour movement. If I had to pick one, that would be the one.",494,127
6,41,interviewer,"I'm curious. You said about the mental side of it as well. What is it, what's mental about the Kong vault?",80,21
6,42,participant,"Getting the feet through the hands, especially the first few times like, I mean, I've been doing parkour six and a half years, so it's fine now. I don't really get scared about it, sometimes on a rail. Just because I'm worried I'm not getting the height. Yeah, the biggest fear that I found when I was younger, and I find in like students now is that they're going to jump up, they're going to try and clear the wall. They're going to clip their toes or their shins, and they're just gonna faceplant into the floor. And I've seen kids do that and they're fine. They always get open, just go, oh pkay. You know, but that fear of just going headfirst because of something that you can't see. I think that's a big part of it as well. Like, you're just trusting that your feet are going to come over. And yeah, there's a certain amount of like, prep you can do, like I went through earlier. But yeah, it's that sort of one of like, at least when I was practising that was the first move I ever learned. And that was the first mental barrier I had to get over was, I'm just gonna have to trust that hte technique that I've got is good enough to get my feet over this wall. If it's not I'm gonna faceplant. We'll get there when we get there. See what happens [laugh]",960,244
6,43,interviewer,"Can you remember, erm, like about your experience learning out? Was it easy or hard?",66,15
6,44,participant,"Yeah, I have a video of it. That's the oldest parkour video I have is of me doing that, learning that move. And yeah, it was fine. It took me like, if between like 40 and 50 minutes, I was just on this like fallen like tree, this huge, like fallen tree near my house. And I had watched a bunch of the tutorials I talked about before, so Tapp Brother, Robbie [unclear], because there wasn't like coaching provision where I lived. And I was like, Oh, you know, actually, I'm just gonna try this. And I sort of like, I almost like, accidentally did the steps I was breaking down before, like, I didn't start the dip because I didn't know that was a thing. But I just practice, like trying to just jump up onto the wall. And it took me ages to even stay on the wall. Like I was jumping up my feet were hitting and I was just bouncing straight off. And then from there, it got to like, okay, I can get my feet on the wall. How far can I get them? How far can I get them? And you can see in the video, like, if you imagine the curve of the trunk, I was hitting the side, hitting the side, sitting the side then I was hitting the top, then I was going over, then I was going over, and then I just cleared and you can do here in the video me just going [breaths in]. And just like absolutely, like yeah! But yeah, I mean, it's, it took a long time. And I think, had I had coaches, had I been coached, then the movement would have taken a lot less time. Because I wouldn't have been correcting my own technique. Someone else would have said, Oh, just dip a little bit more here. I'd be like, nice.",1198,319
6,45,interviewer,"I'm curious, then if you were, if you were kind of self taught, when you started to connect up with other people doing parkour, or particularly when you moved into maybe coaching with actual coaching groups, I think I think you were coaching with a group, right?",208,47
6,46,participant,"Yeah, [name]. I was officially coaching with them for half a year, but I coached for like, a year before that just sort of, I'd turn up and just help so yeah, well, yeah.",126,34
6,47,interviewer,"Yeah, whether whether you, when you started to kind of make those connections, did your kind of self developed technique, did you kind of learn new things when you, or did you find that the thing you self taught yourself matched up with what the other people were doing? Or...?",218,50
6,48,participant,"Yeah, so like, it wasn't wrong, I didn't have to relearn anything. There were like tweaks and improvements to be made, again, mainly the dip, just because I didn't know that was a thing. But it changed it completely. And I mean, it was it was a good like, five years between meetings, like learning that and then starting coaching. So like I was training with, like lots of people before. I dunno like, yeah, I didn't feel it was wrong, didn't have to relearn anything, what I learned just training with people and like, I guess in terms of challenges, like when I was just doing a kong on my own, it was just a kong vault over and over and over again. And there was no variation of that maybe I do it left to right. And I do it right to left over the same obstacle. And then when I met other people, like I saw, there's more opportunity with this. And then when I started trying those challenges and found them difficult, then I would get almost like peer to peer feedback. And you know, someone I trained with would go, Oh, you just need to try lifting your chest a bit higher, or, you know, throw your arms back a bit further. And these little things that made me see that, oh, yeah, it's not just this isolated movement, there are loads of different things I can adjust to change the outcome. And yeah, I mean, the development came much quicker with other people than just on my own.",1072,264
6,49,interviewer,"And now, like as a coach, are you finding that students are like, have some of the same things that you found you could improve or learn from other people? Would you find that there's common things that come up in terms of challenges for students with the movement?",211,49
6,50,participant,"Yeah, so I find that most students come in without knowing what it is and they've not seen they've maybe seen a video of parkour but they can't quite point at it and go that's a Kong vault and they've often not tried it before. And the most common thing is, they sort of run up to it. Punch off and then I don't know it's almost like an instant, No, I'm not gonna put my feet through there and they do like a two handed speed vault when I don't know like, you even if, I've got a bunch of younger siblings, and like when they were younger, like seeing them play in the park and stuff, like, that's how kids just get over things, they put two hands, like as a support point, they throw the rest of their body over and push off. So kids they automatically go into that. So either challenge for kids that haven't done parkour before., for like coaching them it, is going, stop doing that, just put your hand over here. And then it goes into the breakdown again, okay, you're scared to put your feet over the wall. Let's practice just trying to get them up onto the wall. Um but yeah the most challenging thing is I think that kids just come in with the knowledge of being kids playing in the playground. And that's great. Because, you know, I mean, you can watch kids play, and you can see parkour without it having a name, like they're just being kids. They're just playing around. And it's great. And we're it's sort of being like, what you doing is great. But it's not what this is... Yeah, yeah. I keep going on about the dip, because I think it's the most like, it's the thing that's missed the most and the thing that people struggle with the most because they they think I'm trying to go over this wall. Why would I lower myself if I actually want to go up, you know, but that's where the problems come in. If you just jump from straight, you might clip your feet, you're probably not going to clear it unless you've got like the technique nailed. And so again, and to do a movement that perhaps is unfamiliar, like you don't see people walking around, like bent over at 90 degrees. Because that would be weird. We're used to being up where [unclear], so getting people to like crouch down, put their hands on the wall to go up. It's just, it can take a while to get into people's heads. Just because it's not a movement pattern that we're really familiar with. Yeah.",1818,453
6,51,interviewer,"Are there... So what what kind of thing would you be looking for in order to say like, yeah, that's a good, that's a good Kong, or maybe you need to work on this, like a, when you're coaching in particular, are there things you're looking out for, in order to be able to say, yeah, this that was good, or we should work on this, or?",246,67
6,52,participant,"Yeah, so in terms of the takeoff, how far they are from the wall can make a huge difference, if you're too far, you're going to be stretching, and you're not going to get over just gonna sort of crash your hips into the wall. Maybe too close, you're not going to get your feet over. So you're just gonna again probably crash your hips into the wall, say, oh, why don't you try doing that a little bit closer, or a little bit further back. Don't want to go on about the dip anymore, bt the dip, you know, maybe dip a bit lower, or maybe they're dipping too low, like you shouldn't be like touching your nose before, you know sort of thing. Um, the push from the arms, I tend to find is one. And they just sort of put their hands in a wall a bit like you're asking about before, and then not supporting their kids just want to jump and I'm like you've got hands, push your weight through them. And again, that's why I do the exercise of push yourself up and pop your feet onto the wall. And then yeah, yeah, just like coming out of it as well, again, I think related to that sideways movement, a lot of kids they do it, they get their feet through, then they take one arm off. And they sort of end up with this sort of like half spin out of it. And I'm like, just keep that hand on a second longer and push off at the same time. which is again, why I practice, get on the wall, practice pushing off and jumping down. And yeah, I think those are like the main things because when you correct them the rest of it sort of just comes, like, naturally.",1177,308
6,53,interviewer,"And how about in terms of like connecting the vault to other movements or other things? Is it, is it an easy vault to like drop into a route or is it...",116,32
6,54,participant,"Um, for kids, yeah, because like, especially like that first like, couple years of like learning. Like first year perhaps of learning, everything's very punchy. They're very like, they're all in what they're running around in a circle and there might be like a series of obstacles. Well, it's not a constant flow like a wave, stop, punch, over stop, punch over. Um.  I think again, I find that the if you try and get them to do it quicker if you're trying to do it too fast. How am I wording this. If you try and get them to do the movement too fast... This is, this is just I think I'm tripping over myself. Get them to move too quickly, in too short amount of time, they'll go back to just that fear of, I'm going too fast and I'm going to clip my feet. Let's just go to the side, or let's just run into the wall and try again. Yeah, I feel for flow instead of like a punchy, punchy term, it's really easy, because unlike the lazy vault, where they have to stop and think about, okay, I have to put my hand down and swing my legs or when I put my hand down, and then land. It's very simple. You start here you go, you finish it. And that's the move complete. And yeah, I got stuck [unclear]",895,235
6,55,interviewer,"That's all good. So that that little description you gave there about like you, you start here, you go over you stop here. Is that like, I think we might have talked about it. Is that like a typical kind of Kong? Because I think as well, you mentioned, there's like, a whole bunch of variations, like, double Kongs and stuff. Are they their own movement? Or are they extensions of the same movement? It's a bit of a metaphysical question, maybe but I'm curious how people think about these things.",386,91
6,56,participant,"I'd say they're extensions of the same movement. So if if my ultimate goal is to teach someone, the double kong, I teach them the Kong first, so they've got that down, then I'll teach them the dive Kong. And I feel a double Kong is a mix of the two. So the double Kong, obviously, you're doing two, two Kong movements, there are two walls, you put your hand on both sets of walls, and you try to get your feet to clear them. But I think the first Kong in a double kong is a normal kong. Like you're just going up, you try to get as much height as possible. And then from that, you then go into the dive Kong, you get that hip pop, which is very unique to the dive kong. And, and again, if I'm teaching that the elements from the very like foundation, of the kong comes in, I guess someone can do a normal Kong, and a dive kong, but is struggling with a double kong, I'll go okay. First of all, you put your hands on, you got to jump up to your feet. And then as quickly as you come from that, you're going to push off your feet and dive out with that. And that gets them used to like being high popping their hips up. Then as it gets quicker and quicker, I'm like, okay, good. Can you do it and try and like, spend as little time on the wall as possible. And they do that. And they do that. And then it just gets to a point where I'm like, okay, all you need to do now is take off that step where your feet are on the wall. And hopefully by that point, they're hardly putting any weight on it. Like the toes are tapping and they're going off. And there is an element of sort of like the actual send it not as in like you don't know what you're doing, just throw yourself at it but you have all of the movements down. There's one thing that you need to push past and the only way you're going to push past that is to do it. But I've never, I've never heard of anyone learning a double Kong without first knowing in at least what a normal Kong is. The dive kong is so important so because that hip pop is incredibly important.",1540,411
6,57,interviewer,"Is the dive kong, where you're, you're trying to cross like a wider obstacle and so you're diving further before the hands contact?",103,23
6,58,participant,"Yeah, so it's either, it's either diving over a wider obstacle. Because obviously, if you if you if your hands are too short, your feet are going to land on the obstacle, that's not what you want, you want to dive further. But it's also like in terms of like Imax two where there are two walls that you could double Kong, and you're trying to reach the first one. Sometimes, sometimes it's clearing a large obstacle. Sometimes it's jumping over a gap to catch your hands on that wall, and like you could do that, Imax is perhaps a bad example, if there's not an obstacle you have to clear before the second obstacle. So Imax two is actually, you know, is the wall and the second wall. With that, I think the best thing to do is a dive kong because you're gonna have to dive over that headfirst anyway, you're set up for that. But if that wall wasn't there, perhaps an easier option, snd maybe, perhaps an easier options would be to go for like the cat hang or the waist cat. But in terms of efficiency, which is what some people like to define parkour as like, you know, the root cause of your train is to be efficient. Jumping to like a position where you have to stop and then pull up and then pop over is so much slower than just slapping your hands in the wall. So but yeah, like fundamentally it's just for clearing. But for reaching a point on a wall, this, um... that if you were, the dive kong is, you're trying to put your hands where they wouldn't reach if you just were standing still. Like there's a moment in the air where you're feet aren't on the floor. But neither, your hands aren't on the wall and it's that moment of diving like Superman.",1278,317
6,59,interviewer,"Is that, is that kind of different to a, again, a standard, typical kong? In that you're kind of you're diving almost down onto the thing, rather than-",115,28
6,60,participant,Yeah.,4,1
6,61,interviewer,-Going up to it from that dip. You mentioned.,34,9
6,62,participant,"Yeah. So right, yeah. So rather than going up, I think there's still an element of the dip to the dive kong, but, rather than in the normal kong, where you're going down, you're going up and over. And like your hips, they have to pop a little bit so that your feet can get through the gap. We don't have to be way up here, with a dive Kong, you're going up, your hips are going up above your head, I think that's a difference. In the normal Kong, your hips tend to be pretty much in line with your head, but they don't tend to go much higher. Whereas with like the dive kong, you can be at, perhaps an extreme example butyou can be at like 45 degrees, and your head can be the bottom and your feet can be the other end. Yeah, for the dive kong, I think its more, you have to get down low again, but it's not so that you can propel your chest up, it's so that you can pop your hips up. Yeah.",669,183
6,63,interviewer,"Okay. We've actually, like you've been very efficient. And we've, we've got through most of the main points that I try and hit with people. I'm just having a... Yeah, it's great. Makes makes my job easier to transcribe it. Is there anything else kind of about the Kong vault that you can think of that maybe we haven't got to or that you think is important that hasn't come up yet?",290,72
6,64,participant,"I guess it's the move where like, more than anything, you know, your hands are feet. I had a girl say that to me once I think she went to college. And she was like watching all the videos. And she was like, it's bizarre. Like parkour is so weird because your hands become feet. Well, you know, going back to I was saying before about like monkeys and cats and stuff. It's going, Yeah, I've got four limbs. And they're not two arms and two legs. They're just four limbs. And I think with the Kong, like it's a move... I don't think there are many vaults that are too similar to that. Like even in like the lazy vault, or like the dash vault. Well in the lazy vault the hands are more like a pivot point for your body to come round. And then you just push it off, and it's all about the feet. Whereas with the kong like the hands are so important, and for especially for stuff like the dive kong, like there's a moment where all of your weight is on your hands. Yeah, I don't know if that's the point that I just made or if it's just something I've just said. What... Yeah, I think it's like yeah, it's the one where you, yeah, yeah. Where your arms are used not just as like support points, but as like things that you're actually balancing and moving on, like people do Kongs to handstands and stuff. Which I think is mad because I can't handstand. But yeah, it's almost like an inversion of what we're used to, again, is like bipeds, it's not just moving back to being like a quadruped. It's like being an inverted biped. Especially in dive kongs, because your hands are the first thing on the ground. And that's why for a lot of people, it's so scary because we're not used to that. Yeah, yeah.",1288,328
6,65,interviewer,"Yeah, I think-",10,3
6,66,participant,"I think that's getting into like the very nitty gritty of it, that not some theory I really talk about too much in coaching much. It's like an observation I've made mostly based on that comment, which I'd never thought of before in my life, until this girl said this to me.",213,52
6,67,interviewer,"I think it's a really good point. And do you think it means that, um. Maybe that's, you know, I think he said that at the end, though, it's kind of why the movement can be a bit intimidating to people. It's, it's not something that's maybe natural to us. Although people describe it as like an unnatural, even like monkeys and cats and stuff. For us. It's something that we have to learn.",294,74
6,68,participant,"Yeah, we're used to being vertical. Whereas I think more than most of our vaults like the Kong vault exists on a horizontal plane, rather than a vertical plane. Like the lazy vault you start up, you swing your legs around, but you pretty much stay up the whole time. Dash vault, you stay up, you just bring your legs over the wall, but your chest is in place. Whereas the kong, that dip puts you on a horizontal plane where you're try to go over, there's a little bit up but it's a [gesture] rather than a [gesture] I know, you can't transcribe that, because I'm moving my hand. Maybe you can do some funky diagrams [laugh]",478,118
6,69,interviewer,"Yeah. I think that's actually a really, really great insight. That's a really good way to describe it. Cool. So the thing I've been kind of finishing with with a lot of people is to just ask, Is there anything about the Kong vault, the movement, that you're curious to know more about yourself? You know, the questions you might have about it?",266,63
6,70,participant,"I'm sure there's some.... I think, like mostly just is like a curiosity about things I can't do. Like, I don't do any flips. So the idea of like, a kong gainer, some where you're trying to go forwards and then go up, but then you're throwing your feet forwards, up and over to then kick back. Just the mechanics of that baffles me. Like, I just don't understand It. But as for the core, like Kong vault. Don't know, I want I want to find something like really important to see but I can't think of anything [laugh]",386,99
6,71,interviewer,"Okay. Just because I noticed I've made a note about it, and I forgot to ask you, I think you used the word efficient for the vault at some point.",111,30
6,72,participant,Yeah.,4,1
6,73,interviewer,"Does efficient mean, fast? Or what? What's your kind of use of efficient for it?",61,15
6,74,participant,"I think in parkour there's like two stages to efficient. So the primary one is speed, is how fast you can go. But, I think the reason we don't say in terms of speed is because it's a second element, which is important, but perhaps not always seen as important, which is like energy conservation. Like there's a reason that we don't hurdle walls, generally, there's a reason that the Kong has more preference to a hurdle, because I think a hurdle take some more energy, you have to generate more power because you're only using your legs. Whereas with the Kong, you're spreading out that energy using your arms as well. And it's a pre even like ratio of how much I've not done the like, research into how much like forces are actually put on but to me for me like someone practices and teaches us. It's a pretty 50-50 split, you take off with your legs, you push with your arms, and then you land and it's pretty even. And so I think in terms of conserving energy, so that you can carry on and being as efficient as possible, is important as well. Where in terms of parkour in general, I think a lot of people forget that efficiency isn't just speed. I think it does do both, with speed as like the primary part of that. And then energy conservation as a secondary part.",988,240
6,75,interviewer,"Cool. Okay, I think that's everything. Awesome. Okay. Yeah, unless there's anything else that you want to add. That's come to mind. I'll stop the recording.",118,26
6,76,participant,"Yeah, no, I'm good.",12,4
6,77,interviewer,I'm good. Okay.,10,3
7,1,participant,Gotcha.,6,1
7,2,interviewer,"All right, there we go. So, yeah, so the study is just kind of looking to talk to parkour coaches and practitioners out there and talk about some of the movements that that we do. And how people understand them, how they learnt them, how they coach them themselves, with a view to kind of understand these things for a, like a decentralised sport like parkour is, you know, there's not like a central organisation or rulebook, or it's just kind of organically grown over time. So it's just kind of seeing how, although it's spread, organically seeing how people kind of understand these movements that have become kind of known parkour movements. And so I just picked the Kong vault, as like kind of a well known movement to start with just to kind of start exploring these things. But I guess in that case, the first thing to kind of ask you is, is that the term that you're familiar with, Kong vault, or do you know it as something else or...?",741,174
7,3,participant,"I would say that generally, um, the Kong vault would be the overall like, most common term that people use, but I've also heard an awful lot of catpass. And back when I started, you know, in 2011, 2012, some people were calling it a monkey vault at that time. But I would say the general consensus is that Kong is the most widely understood term for the technique that we're discussing.",302,72
7,4,interviewer,"Do you know, do you know how that term came about? Just out of curiosity?",56,15
7,5,participant,"Um, I don't know, specifically, but you know, if I had to guess it kind of looks like Donkey Kong, you know, the way that he would just move around in the video game. So it's a it's a fitting name.",146,41
7,6,interviewer,So is that is that the term you'd use for coaching and whatnot?,49,13
7,7,participant,"Yes, I would use Kong vault.",21,6
7,8,interviewer,"And how, I know, obviously, these things tend to be very visual, especially in coaching, you know, we tend to demonstrate stuff, but how would you describe the movement, just?",137,30
7,9,participant,"Alright, so I would definitely describe it during class through demonstration. But I would say that it is a symmetrical vault where you place both hands on the object and your body moves through that the plane between your two hands.",190,41
7,10,interviewer,"Okay. And if you, er, if you ertr going to kind of try and break it down into into maybe stages or, you know, give a bit more detail about the movement, are there, how would, how would you kind of describe it further I guess.",171,46
7,11,participant,"Sure. So the first stage is the run up. And when you begin running up into a kong, it's going to be different than a sprint, or even a long jump approach. It's going to be as you're running, you continue to lower your body so that, like you do it gradually, I would not recommend, you know, starting upright and then going down, but you kind of as you're running, you gradually lower yourself so that you're in the prime position to take off. As you're doing that, you want to be at a low point when you get into your penultimate and final step, which are going to ultimately determine your trajectory and how much power you're going to get for the kong. During those two steps. You, um, on the third to last step, you're going to take a long stride, gaining into your second to last step, and then quickly go right into your final step. So you're it's almost like a plyo takeoff, except your feet are split. So you could even call it a gallop. For the for the final step and the takeoff, your arms are back as you're in that gallop position, your chest is low. And as you take off, you want to reach with your arms while raising your hips simultaneously. That's actually a technique that I learned pretty recently, um, I've noticed that like, if you get your hips higher, then there's less distance that your centre of mass has to travel over the wall. So if from that position, it's just easier to go further. So you want to you want to have that form. You want to make sure that you're taking off nice and far from the wall when you do that, so you have space for your legs to clear and carry through. From there now you're at takeoff. You want to pull your arms back, you know as you push off the wall, allow your chest to rise point with the toes while watching for your landing to prepare for whatever you're going to do out of it, be it a stick, a safety out, dash.",1445,362
7,12,interviewer,So can you do it with other types of takeoff as well?,41,12
7,13,participant,"So you can do a Kong vault from a purely two footed, like stance, a lot of the time, people will do standing dive kongs, and even standing kong precisions. And it does work. But with momentum, doing that punch footed takeoff is gonna, you know, decrease your power, you're going to decrease the amount of strength that you have going into it. The gallop through trial and error, people must have figured out that it was just a more efficient way to transfer the force, the momentum.",380,88
7,14,interviewer,So is that transferring it... to go up? Or to go forward? Or...,43,13
7,15,participant,"So I would say that um, probably to go forward because it has to do with your momentum, punching will actually send you soaring, it'll send you up quite a bit. Punching will decrease your horizontal, horizontal momentum. It's like, it's like punching like stops you and then you keep going. It like re-translates it. So you know, the gallop allows you to kind of smoothly like do it, you basically do what the punch is doing in two steps like the second, like the first, and let the penultimate step kind of lowers you even further and really primes, you, and then that last step really launches you off. So it can happen more smoothly as you take off for the Kong.",522,124
7,16,interviewer,"And so you mentioned, like trajectory, and power as well.",45,10
7,17,participant,Right.,5,1
7,18,interviewer,"Are they, is that stuff kind of coming from the takeoff?",44,11
7,19,participant,"That stuff comes from you, your trajectory is going to come from your takeoff, and also, it's going to come from the way that your arms push, you know, um, if you want to get height, like for example, if I'm going for a kong precision that's higher than what I'm taking off of, I'm not going to pull at all, I'm going to straight push, it is like a dip at that point, because I'm only looking to get height, I'm not going to be looking to get any distance. But if you're looking to maintain your height while getting distance, like what you would need for, say, a level kong precision, you're going to want to push and then also follow through quite a bit. So that you're encouraging your body to, to contain that to maintain that trajectory and follow that path. When you're going downwards, you know, you still want to pop, but it's gonna definitely be a lot more of that sliding motion, and maintaining your speed through through your takeoff, to get the distance. Like, besides what your arms are doing, the speed of your takeoff is gonna make a huge impact on how far you're able to travel. Like the biggest thing that I find that even up to like intermediate, even some advanced athletes do is as they're running up to the wall, they subconsciously slowed down in their last two steps. And it's not a conscious process for most people. But like the challenge is in getting like, comfortable, you know, approaching the wall, and, you know, going aggressive in that last second, like I love the term Kong because you know it kinda it kind of like emphasises that like gorilla nature that you kind of have to have as you go in at a kong like it is one of the most aggressive moves in my opinion. Like you really need to, like fully go for it and fully apply like the full range of all the techniques in order to get the distance. And you know, if even one variable is off, you're gonna you're gonna be off the money for you know, making the stick.",1517,368
7,20,interviewer,"So is that, is that aggressiveness like... because, because of that need for like a commitment to really dive in headfirst or...?",99,22
7,21,participant,"It's, yeah, it's basically just the simple fact that you're running at a brick wall or at a railing. You know, it's something that I think brains have a hard time dealing with when you start doing parkour. So a lot of the time I see it in people, but um, yeah, like that's where training comes in. And repetition comes in because there's a there's definitely a disconnect between knowing technique, especially like with Kongs, and like with laches and stuff like that, and execute, and comfortably executing. It's like not being in fight-flight when you're doing it, so that you know you're calm, and you can just focus on exactly what you're doing. And yeah, usually, that works the best.",536,123
7,22,interviewer,Does that kind of come come from just repetition?,40,9
7,23,participant,"It comes from repetition, I would recommend breathing, knowing your technique. Also, like, for a lot of people, they bash their knee, like once on a Kong. And that really slows them down. That's really why we need that space that we were discussing earlier, like the space between your very last step, and the wall is gonna allow you the room to the room for your knees to clear also raising your hips is going to give you room for your knees to clear and maintaining your speed as you do so. So, you know, knowing the technique and being confident in the technique, really, I feel like eliminates fear, because and by doing that over and over again, it's not just the logical of knowing, like I know the technique, you know, you have the backlog of experience of doing the techniques so that there's nothing to worry about.",649,151
7,24,interviewer,"Do you find that it's like, a difficult move for people to learn?",50,13
7,25,participant,"It depends on the person. Um, it's difficult for people if they have left-right imbalances. So if say, the right side of their body is much more coordinated than their left side and their and they have a tendency to like list to one side, they're going to have a very hard time straightening out their kong. That's the most common issue I see is people doing, you know, side vaults or like modified kash vaults, as they're learning to do a Kong. Um, so for that specific thing, I have a drill that I teach my students, which is, um, I teach them to kong up, first. So I have them basically run out a block, and they kong, they do the Kong, and instead of looking to clear, they do it to their feet landing in the middle. And they'll repeat the process of doing that three to five times, and then I'll tell them, okay, now do faster. And then they do that like three times, then I say, do it even faster. And it gets to a point where their feet are just barely tapping the block. And by then I'm like, Okay, now do it again, keep your hips high, and tuck in your knees, and a lot of the time they end up clearing. So that's, that definitely does it, I also will tell my students to remember to put equal weight on both of their hands. Because the tendency to list to one side and look like a side vault tends to be from that. Um, and then yeah, and then the other thing is getting people comfortable mentally with doing things on their opposite side. So like, if you can get a student to feel comfortable doing a side vault, to their right side, when they always go to their left side, then they don't necessarily have to resort to going to that side as a bailout, because they're scared in the movement, like they kind of have a little bit more proprioception of where their body is, so that they can remain in line and know what being in line actually feels like. I feel like a lot of students aren't quite conscious of that yet. What being aligned feels like.",1517,381
7,26,interviewer,"So is it, do you find that it's perhaps not a, er, I don't want to say like a not a natural movement, but like, it's not something that people kind of instinctively might do, without without being shown first, or...?",162,41
7,27,participant,"Let me think about that one. Is it not natural? I believe it is natural, but it's not comfortable. It's just not comfortable for a lot of people. I would imagine that, you know, in the wild people were doing a lot more safety vaults, and side vaults than Kong vaults. So I guess, I guess yeah, it's probably not the most natural of movements. It's not the most natural but it becomes very useful once you know how to use it.",326,82
7,28,interviewer,"What, erm, why would it be useful? What kind of things is it useful for?",54,15
7,29,participant,"It's useful for I'm essentially getting distance when there's a wall in front of you, if you want to, if you want to jump and you're like, say getting chased. You can only really effectively take off of like such a height and then it becomes like a huge step up or you have to stop and plyo off of it. There comes a point where, you know, just being able to push yourself over it and travel becomes the more efficient way and it opens up a whole lot of challenges. So in those regards, it's very useful also, um, in certain contexts, a dive kong may be faster than doing like a plyo down or say like or safety vault down depending. So it like that. And then with double Kongs, if you really want to travel distance and you really feel comfortable with them, you can travel further on the double kong than you can on on a Kong Precision and even on a standing precision, um, not that I recommend, you know, going for 10 foot double Kongs for everybody like I don't do those, but, but it's theoretically possible. Like if you look at like what [name] done what some of the French guys have done with double Kongs, like they can soar like 11, 12 feet off of these things.",908,226
7,30,interviewer,"Is, um. Is that kind of that ability to travel quite far on the other side of it an important factor? Is that something useful rather?",105,26
7,31,participant,"So the ability to travel far, like on a Kong Precision? You mean? It's just-",57,15
7,32,interviewer,"[overlap] Yeah, yeah. The move in general, I guess.",37,9
7,33,participant,"Yeah, the, um, part of the utility of the Kong vault is that it's the most powerful of all of the vaults, as opposed to safeties or dashes or anything, Kong is always going to make you go the furthest. As long as you know, you know how to do it. So Kongs are effective in that, you know, out of the vault, you're going to go the furthest.",256,69
7,34,interviewer,"Okay. Is, um, just to kind of rewind a tiny bit, is the upper body contributing to that distance? Or is it all coming from the takeoff?",103,27
7,35,participant,"I would say it's, maybe... 60-40. 60% legs, 40%, arms and upper body. Um, cos you know, you need to make sure your arms job on the takeoff is to give you some extra power and distance, but it's also to help you position your chest right, so that you can land like safely and comfortably. So, like, yes, it's more so a jump, like, it's almost like that staggered plyo, like we were talking about. But yeah, the arms do help.",313,83
7,36,interviewer,"So that that kind of when you're over the obstacle, you know, there's obviously going to be a bunch of different ways you could land and heights and distances and all sorts of objects you could land on. But is there is there like a certain way you want to be coming out of the movement to be safe, or, or...?",237,61
7,37,participant,"Yes. So there's particularly um, let's go over the one thing that you don't want to do, and then I'll explain, like what you do want to do. So what you don't want is your chest down. So I'm gonna stand up and show you like, so if you do, you're kong, and your chest is too far over. You know, you end up flailing and you're uncomfortable. We, we, in the Long Island community call that Millennium Falconing, or Falconing for short [laugh] And so so to avoid that, like, what we do is as we fall through, we make sure that we push, like with the chest and you raise with the chest, like as I kong, I go like this [raises chest] so that I allow my chest to rise as I'm pushing so I can stick out my feet, bring my arms back and come in for a nice landing. It's all in chest positioning and being mindful of the fact that I'm pushing through the chest using everything.",655,173
7,38,interviewer,"And is that is that only if you're trying to land on something for like a precision or is that also if you're trying to come out to a run, it's generally good to get the chest up?",137,38
7,39,participant,"I would say that's generally good technique. Um, you know, I was doing a Kong splat back over the weekend. And for that, you know, you still want to keep your chest in a safe position, like in an upright somewhat position. But I did come forward, you know, to do the splat back because that's part of the technique. But that was very intentional. And still, of course, my feet were hitting the trees surface before, you know, my upper body wasn't anywhere close to it. So I modified it slightly, but, you know, the same principles still apply.",420,100
7,40,interviewer,"I'm curious as well, you know, with the various ways you could take off, or the various ways you can land. And you've mentioned some of the like variations like double Kong as well. Like are these all just variation on the same movement? Do you think? Or are they distinct?",213,51
7,41,participant,"Yeah, like they're all Kongs because you know they're the symmetrical two handed vaults going through a plane that lies within the two hands. Um, so in that regard, yes, they are all the same, but the techniques, but the techniques are going to be different. I would say that somebody who has proficiency in like one type of vault one type of kong may or may not have proficiency in another type like I know some people are excellent at dive konging, but aren't anything crazy remarkable at double konging, I mean, or at like Kongs precisioning but for a double Kong I feel like you need to you need to have skill in both. Like I would argue that double Kong is the most advanced Kong skill, maybe triple Kongs and whatever you know, but double Kong generally takes like a Kong Precision sort of takeoff and then it goes into a dive kong in midair.",673,158
7,42,interviewer,And that you really need to get the hips up.,34,10
7,43,participant,"Yes, you really need to get the hips up. The way I learned was I started with Kong Precision then I went to Kong safety then I went to Kong dive roll, and then I went to double Kong.",140,39
7,44,interviewer,"Cool. How um, mentioning about, about yourself learning double Kongs? How, how did you find learning the Kong for yourself, back in the day?",110,24
7,45,participant,"I found the Kong to be very challenging because I had that left-right, um, non-symmetrical thing going on. I was very, I would always list to the right side like my hips would always pick up this way as I would do my Kongs. And you can even see it sometimes in my dive Kongs, if I'm doing one that's like at the edge of my range, I will shift my hips a little that way still. Um, so that was really my big struggle with them. But like as I started getting comfy with them, they're great fun, like they're an awesome move to do. Like you can apply them to so many different scenarios. But it was a process to get there. I also want to mention that rail kongs are a bit of a different animal, in that a rail kong, you have to change your approach and your running speed. And you have to pull as opposed to push you like if you try pushing on a rail, you're rolling the dice on your hands being perfect. Like it's really like, people do it. I've seen people go huge on rail kongs, you know, doing sketchy tech, and you know, hats off to them. They're comfy with it, but, but like, if you're like the rest of us and you don't really want to faceplant like you need to grab and pull, you know, and that really makes for... I tend to have like a slightly slower run up. And then really, really emphasise those last two steps and accelerating through those last, those last two steps as I as I go to grab and really rip the rail behind me, I got like, I'm almost doing like a row with it, like, pulling it really, really hard in that movement.",1175,307
7,46,interviewer,Mm.,2,1
7,47,participant,So it that in that way the technique changes.,36,9
7,48,interviewer,So it's more it becomes more of a pull than a push.,38,12
7,49,participant,"Yes. And you also want to um, switch up your driving distance because now we you're, you can't go quite as hard. You kind of want to dive from further away. And still and like junk to kind of make up for that. Like on a I'm on like a fence like a high kong that's on like a rail. So it's like a fence or something, you really want to make sure that you have enough distance to clear your body because now you're not pushing to give yourself height to clear it. So you need to dive to make sure that you still have enough room to clear that object. You see, it's like um, you're trying to find a different way to compensate for the lack of push.",493,131
7,50,interviewer,Is that is that because you can't get the hand flat?,40,11
7,51,participant,"Right? You you don't have enough space. It's um, it's a lack of space thing. And like I said, some people will do it. It's just you know, it's riskier.",109,30
7,52,interviewer,"So would you would you encounter a similar thing if you had just like a really thin wall, like if it was still flat in theory, but just kind of less less wide than your hand-",136,36
7,53,participant,"I hate those kind of kong pres, those are the worst-",40,11
7,54,interviewer,The worst of both worlds?,20,5
7,55,participant,"[laugh] Yeah, it's like, yeah, it is the worst of both worlds because you can't fully grab it, you can't, you got to like, kind of push. Those ones are tough, I'll tell you those ones are tough. Um, yeah, it's almost like a rail kong in those situations. But you know, you because you can't grab around, you still need to try and push. So every single Kong, what's interesting is that you kind of have to figure out what is going to work when you're in that grey area, it's going to be a little bit of application of both techniques, which is, you know, yet again, why having a backlog of experience of practice on all these different types of surfaces makes weird encounters like that, you know, more usable, or like if they're different levels, or whatever the case may be.",593,145
7,56,interviewer,So the kind of environment you're performing it in has a has an effect on the movement?,69,17
7,57,participant,"100% 100%, every different type of Kong that you encounter is going to have a different sort of movement. I've done kong precisions, from little walkway, curbs that are yay-high off the ground, you know, and I'm basically doing a toe touch as I'm running at it, you know, my hips are like, way higher than my head. I'm like, I look like a little Gremlin running like, but it but that's the way do the technique when it's that low. Because it's all hips, and it's all push for that. Um, yeah, so every single kong is going to have a different technique to some extent.",432,108
7,58,interviewer,"But I guess, you know, that's kind of part of what I'm doing the study for the the common feature then, is that two hands, feet and knees between the hands kind of characteristics?",140,34
7,59,participant,"Yes, the two hands, feet, and two hands, feet and knees clear. And the plyo, the plyo esque nature of the takeoff, and then the plyo esque nature of the hand push, like the hand push and pull is almost like a second plyo. I actually read that in um, do you know Max Henry?",207,55
7,60,interviewer,Yes.,3,1
7,61,participant,"Yeah, I read in his book, that, um, that, you know, basically, the Kong is a plyo, followed by another player with the hands. And I've taken that and ran with it. And I definitely see that as true. It's like, it's a plyo. And then your hands as sits the prior that you just did to really launch you in the direction you're going.",247,65
7,62,interviewer,"Hmm. What about if, if someone has like particularly good flexibility or mobility, and they can just not even take their hands off the obstacle and just jump their feet through the middle?",152,33
7,63,participant,Like a kash vault?,14,4
7,64,interviewer,I guess it would become a cash flow by that point wouldn't it. So the kind of pop with the hands you think is is kind of integral to the Kong otherwise it becomes more like a kash?,140,38
7,65,participant,"Well, when it becomes like a kash, by keeping your hands on that long, you're inadvertently going to have to shift your weight to make sure that you're able to reach reach like that. And in doing so, you're killing your forward momentum. So you're not gonna travel as far I like, I can guarantee that it's a great move for flow. And for connecting lines, you know, sometimes even in a speed situation, like if you can't make the full distance going into a kash, when you have a little bit less power is more efficient. Um, but that would not generally be good for the exit distance.",453,109
7,66,interviewer,"So, so we talked a little bit about, like, you know, you learn again, did you learn the Kong vault from somewhere in particular? Can you remember, or did you just see it and experiment?",143,35
7,67,participant,"So I learned from a couple different places, I remember watching some Tapp Brother videos on YouTube as a little kid, um, and then I remember being introduced through some people in the parkour community where I lived. I saw them doing Kong vaults, and they were giving me drills, basically the Kong up drill that I teach my students I learned from just community sessions with the guys and then I took parkour classes at a local gymnastics gym for the first two years of my training where I learned the progression of Kong precision, Kong safety, Kong dive roll, and then the double Kong and dive Kongs. Like, I learned all that stuff in the gym, like, and then from there, I started taking the movements outside.",571,129
7,68,interviewer,"And when you started to move into coaching, did you, did you find that, you know, you had to update your idea of the kong vault in any way or did you just take what you already had and just start coaching basically, that?",172,44
7,69,participant,"I find that coaching is always, it's dynamic. First of all, you know, as a coach, you can't forget that you're always a student as well. And that, you know, there's always more to learn about any technique. So, the way I teach Kongs has evolved a little bit in that, um, you know, like I said, I just learned that hips up technique from one of my friends, you know, so I'm just continuing to pick up techniques, and as I learn techniques, I transfer them right on through to my students. Um, but yeah, really, a lot of the general ideas I've had for a good couple years on how to do Kongs, but it's, it's an ongoing process. And I always want to give my students the most up to date, version of my knowledge. I'm, like, really, the challenge with students is wording things in a way that makes it click for them, and giving them the right progressions, so that they can feel comfortable to do it.",683,172
7,70,interviewer,"And is there, are there any places that you kind of look to, to get that kind of the updated information as you go on, or places where you maybe discuss things like this?",133,34
7,71,participant,"Really, it's very informal, like besides the book, Max's book, um, it's very informal, it's like, at jams, we just talk we're working on a catpass we're working on Kong, you know, and I'm like, Oh, you want to try like this? Like, what do you think of that technique, take a look at this from the side, watch me, you know, we all just analyse each other. And we'll give each other feedback, and then take that. That's, that's more so I would say how I've learned.",342,88
7,72,interviewer,Quite a kind of social community thing.,32,7
7,73,participant,"Very social, very social, very communal, sometimes arguing, but [laugh] you know.",63,12
7,74,interviewer,"Has anyone had like, completely wild and different ideas about these things that you've gone, I dunno where they thought that, got that from, or do people kind of tend to come towards the similar similar conclusions?",174,37
7,75,participant,"People tend to come to similar conclusions, but sometimes, sometimes they do things in different ways. Um, there's one dude, I know who, um, he's, he's a sketchy jumper, like, I'm going to talk about his jump, like, he doesn't really stick his legs out at all, he can go far. He's basically like, his mentality is I run fast. And then I took my knees, run fast jump and tuck my knees. And he just does it. And he I haven't seen him really hurt himself doing it yet. But you know, that's a pretty that's a pretty out there kind of training technique that I would never tell, I would never tell my students do that. But for him, it works. Um, the, my friend who taught me about the hips, he was, you know, he wasn't training for that long. He just kind of discovered that one. And then told me about it. I saw him I noticed I was like, dude, like, whenever you kong, like, your hips are like, high. Kinda like, um, you know, like the blue shorts, brothers.",715,185
7,76,interviewer,"Yeah, I know the video you're talking about, actually.",42,9
7,77,participant,"Yes. Yeah. That's sort of the way that I noticed my friend was Kong. And I asked him about it. And he kind of explained it and broke down. Why that why like, he was doing that. And he's been training probably like three years. And for three years of doing parkour, he's never clipped his knees. So I think that it's a safer technique as well as more powerful. And it's, you know, obviously excellent for dives and doubles.",324,80
7,78,interviewer,"I remember the famous video that came out for them. And I remember watching it and just being like, what are they doing? It looked it was so obviously different to what I was used to seeing. I remember that I'm gonna have to go back and watch that video.",199,50
7,79,participant,Mmhmm. Really inspired me.,21,4
7,80,interviewer,"Yeah, it's very cool. How, how do you get the hips higher? Just thinking about it? What is it? Is it just jumping more or is it being more willing to put your head down or...?",129,36
7,81,participant,"It's not your head, it's um, it's basically hips is a nice way of saying it it's your butt, you know, you lift your butt up, you know, you want to basically keep your butt higher and also like run with like your back a little bit round, like arched and like, almost hollow. It's kind of like a hollow position that you're in. Like, as you as I take off for the Kong, I'm not just doing this, I'm going. So I go like that and like, pushes up. That's how you'll really like get the, get the angle for it.",373,102
7,82,interviewer,So it comes from kind of the position you're in on takeoff.,46,12
7,83,participant,Yes.,3,1
7,84,interviewer,Setting yourself up for that.,24,5
7,85,participant,"Setting myself up for it. And I also think about consciously lifting them up as I'm running. So like, I'm running in almost a hollow position as I'm dipping down, so I'm ready ready for it?",145,36
7,86,interviewer,"Okay, so just with coaching in general, I can't remember if I've already asked this, do you find that, erm, people coming to classes and things, find that they want to learn that movement? Do they know what it is before they come along? Or is it brand new to them?",203,51
7,87,participant,"So- Everybody has seen a Kong vault, but they don't know that it's a Kong vault. I'll be, I'll show them the move and they're like, oh my god, I've seen that before. Like, what is that? It's like Kong vault and wall runs. And then like wall flips, all that kind of stuff. Like they all see it. And they all want to do it. But they don't know. They don't know. That's the name of it. I've had people like, ask me like, what's the move where you put your hands down and you're like diving at something? I'm like, oh, Kong vault.",385,105
7,88,interviewer,Mm hmm.,5,2
7,89,participant,I've had that a few times.,19,6
7,90,interviewer,"So is it, do you think it's quite like a famous parkour move? Is it is it like, identifiably, oh if you see that guy's doing parkour, that kind of thing?",115,31
7,91,participant,"Sure. Oh, for sure. Yeah, for sure. Kong is one of those things, I can't help but think of like, the speed vault like the speed air man, David Belle silhouette, as like an image of parkour. Um, you know, the running and standing precision are very important. The wall run is very important. Those are all very, like staple parkour moves that anybody would see and be like, Oh, he's doing parkour, you know? Yeah, they see. Yeah, they see you doing like something more obscure like trying for like a level four climb up there. Like what's he doing? He's just messing around on a wall.",447,108
7,92,interviewer,"Mm. So I find it interesting use the word like, staple parkour movement. So is it, is it, is the Kong vault something that you think, you know, if someone comes along to learn parkour, that's a thing they should learn? Or at least try?",180,45
7,93,participant,"Absolutely, absolutely. Um, you know, I know a few athletes who have limitations in their wrists where they can't do Kong vaults. But without fail, they all want to do Kong vaults. Like sticking a nice kong precision is just a very satisfying experience. I would say there, yeah, it's a nice move to know and have in your arsenal, especially now where I am in Florida. The community is, um, has an influence from like the Spaniards and then like the Florida community was all about like going big for a long time. So kong pres are a big part of what we do here.",438,106
7,94,interviewer,"Mm. Do you think as well they kind of lend themselves to quite, I mean, you say big, like, just impressive movements as well?",96,24
7,95,participant,"Yes. Kongs look good on camera. Definitely. You know, you get the person midway, their arms fully drawn back that, like intense face? It's um, yeah, it definitely is one that, you know, does well on social media.",162,38
7,96,interviewer,"Mm. So when when people come to classes, and they're like, I want to learn this move that I have you found that people pick it up pretty easy? Or is it a hard one for people to learn?",139,39
7,97,participant,"It depends on the person. I've had people learn it in their first day, and I've had people a month or two in still struggling on it. It really depends on individual coordination and their ability to manage their own fear. That's really a big factor in parkour, that I think some coaches talk about, but I don't think enough coaches talk about is that, you know, students are scared a lot of the time because it's very unfamiliar to them. And, you know, getting especially a non athletic student who doesn't, you know, hasn't done any sports or gymnastics or anything before to do it. You know, you really need to make them feel comfortable before, they're in the mindset for committing to, you know, something that they might perceive as dangerous or scary.",596,135
7,98,interviewer,"Are the, like common coaching cues or exercises you'd use to teach people the movement?",70,15
7,99,participant,"Yeah, like what I went over before with the Kong ups. Yeah, that's, that's a big one. That's definitely definitely a big one. And with that one, what I start with is, I start them doing it standing. And then I have them run into it. And when I start them running into it, I have them punch. And over time I develop I teach them how to do the stagger because if you, essentially the gallup like jump is like a punch, but it's in two steps. So it's more, it's more comfortable for them learning that way. That's the way that I learned. Um, and yeah, like from there, once they're able to do the Kong through, I start, you know, working them on, you know, takeoff distance and exit distance. And then I also have them try it out of moves, like, from a two footed stance, you know, like a, like a, say, a standing precision dive kong out, you know, and I start introducing them to other circumstances where they can do the vaults, but um, as for drills, that's the main drill I have them do, and I start them, if I have it available for me, I start them on a soft block as opposed to something hard, so that they, you know, aren't as afraid of their knees.",871,226
7,100,interviewer,"Is, um, what, what are the things you're kind of looking for, in terms of assessing how someone, how good someone is doing at the Kong vault, when you're coaching them? Are there are there things you're kind of looking at going ah, they need to change this or need to improve that, anything...",225,54
7,101,participant,"Of course, but first one other thing, um, if they're really struggling to get their feet through, I have them do this exercise. I have them stand still with the with the wall in front of them like this. And I have them just jump and stick their butt up. I have them go like this. And from doing that, jumping, pushing their butt up, they can get used to the height that they're going to need for their feet to clear",321,82
7,102,interviewer,out getting the hips up again.,24,6
7,103,participant,"Yes, getting the hips up again. It's quite important. Yes. So for assessment, yeah, I'm going to look at their hip position. I'm going to look for symmetry in their kong. I'm going to look for them dipping before takeoff, I'm going to look for whether their feet are together or staggered, how fast they're running, whether or not they're stopping. Um, what they're chest positioning is upon takeoff. I'm going to look at all of those different things.",350,79
7,104,interviewer,"Are there any kind of, I forgot, if you said... Okay, so, at the moment, you're coaching, self employed, I believe, right? Were you previously part of a coaching organisation?",132,30
7,105,participant,"Yes, I was. I've coached at two different gyms. So the first gym that I worked at was called [name]. I ended up working there for about six months until they closed down the parkour programme. I worked with a couple other coaches, it was a big, big facility, they had like a nice parkour gym set up, I had whatever I need to teach them basically all the skills of parkour. When I switched gyms, it was more of a fitness studio, it's known as [name]. And there, it's basically they had some vault boxes, and some little precision trainers. And that was about it. So a little bit more challenging to make do, but it was a more intimate setting, I got to know the kids really well. So it ended up being quite successful in that way. And then COVID hit, and now I'm just doing my thing on my own.",608,154
7,106,interviewer,"Yeah, great isn't it.",15,4
7,107,participant,[laugh],5,1
7,108,interviewer,"I'm curious when you were working with, you know, an organisation, were there any kind of guidelines on how to coach particular skills to people or any kind of you guys get together as a group or was it just down to the individual?",183,44
7,109,participant,"So we had a monthly curriculum, but, um, I don't know not to, not to be conceited or whatever, but I would kind of ignore the curriculum, like, I would listen to the curriculum, but then kind of like, go beyond it. And then my classes ended up having the most kids at the gym, like at the first gym. And I think it was because I was very dynamic to whatever the kids were wanting that day, or like, whatever, um, whatever it seemed like they needed to learn or whatever, we hadn't hit the previous week. So it was kind of intuitive. And I would always be building upon what they learned the week before, so that they're just adding the pieces and putting the puzzle pieces together. Like even if it was like explicitly stride week, I was gonna do like, Kong, stride out of it, you know, do two steps, you know, do a safety, stride out of it, you know, so I'm trying to throw everything together within the context of whatever the monthly goal was.",731,181
7,110,interviewer,"One of the things I've kind of been curious about talking to a whole bunch of parkour coaches is, you know, a lot of these things, it's it seems to be down to the individual coach to how they want to coach these movements. Do you think it's, it would be useful for us as a community to kind of have more guidelines be like, hey, this works for coaching the Kong vault, this doesn't, or...",297,76
7,111,participant,"Yes, but I wonder who would want to do it without monetizing it? Because I know that something similar to that already exists with the APEX guys out in Colorado, with their Parkour EDU programme. Like they, they've already written out curriculums and guidelines, and all and all this sort of stuff, but I believe it's copyrighted material. So it would be wonderful, but I don't know, you know, who's gonna make those standardisations.",345,74
7,112,interviewer,"The, the only reason I kind of I'm trying to explore this with people is because I am curious how much of the kind of like, people don't kind of want to put restrictions on parkour. You know, we've all benefited from it being a wide open movement, discipline, or whatever you want to call it. Sport, martial art, I don't know, whatever people call it. But-",274,67
7,113,participant,All the above.,11,3
7,114,interviewer,"It seems like it's kind of evolving into into being a little bit more organised. I'm just curious how people kind of feel about that, whether those two things having guidelines for for coaching and safekeeping and stuff can can coexist with a wide open decentralised kind of sport.",228,49
7,115,participant,"I think guidelines would be good. And we really do have guidelines, like they're just informal guidelines. Like if you um, if you go to a gym, your town, you're going to see most people doing their precisions with feet together, drawing their arms back midair and bring their arms forward upon landing. It's um, there's a lot of different things like that. Kongs already have sort of a generalised, you know, guideline, it's just not explicitly stated, I feel like, I feel like we, within the parkour community, we visually know, like, if you're an athlete who's been training more than like, two years, you can visually tell when somebody does or doesn't know, a technique, but, you know, having some kind of real statement of exactly what it should be would be really nice. Because then, you know, then, you know, that serves as a nice reference guide for any beginner. Mm hmm. But I think it does already kind of exist in the minds of, of like practitioners and like, within the mind of a community.",781,179
7,116,interviewer,Do you think that's just kind of just kind of sprung up over time?,51,14
7,117,participant,"It's, it's like, almost like social, like, it sounds, it sounds funny, but like, it's, um, it's almost like when you train with a group, it almost is like social cohesion, like, everybody has, like good tech, you know, or like, you try to have like, the right tech. And, yeah, like, I think that it kind of just comes from social understanding within our community. Like, its um, you know, it's just kind of learned, you visually pick it up. You know, if a lot of people who start now just watch Instagram videos, and if you watch enough Instagram videos of people doing parkour, you can see what those techniques should look like.",481,115
7,118,interviewer,"Just to kind of, the good things kind of spread.",37,10
7,119,participant,"Yeah, good things spread. And yeah, techniques and ideas spread. And, you know, videos of people doing them are kind of the justification or the proof that whatever they're doing is working.",151,32
7,120,interviewer,Mm,2,1
7,121,participant,"Mm-hmm. But if there were to be if there were to be a group of people who said, okay, so after interviewing 100 coaches, you know, this is what the consensus agreed upon was the best technique. And then you tested that with a bunch of students, and had like an experiment where you had them do like, YouTube technique, or just try and figure it out off of a video without explanation, as opposed to with the explanation, you know, and you could, you know, find a nice way to do a controlling variable of it, you could, you could probably figure out a nice way to get people learning the techniques through it. I think that would be really, really useful for beginners.",524,126
7,122,interviewer,"Yeah, I mean, it's it's not kind of the main intention of this study, but it's something that I've found even in just talking to a few people so far is that coaches from, you know, all over the world? The answers I'm getting from people are remarkably consistent.",203,49
7,123,participant,Are they?,7,2
7,124,interviewer,Mmm.,3,1
7,125,participant,"What, what, um, I don't know if you can disclose this, but what kind of similarities and differences have you heard?",90,21
7,126,interviewer,"I mean, it's, it's been a lot of the, a lot of the similar things that you've said, you know, the thing that's really identifiable with the kong is the two hands on the obstacle, feet through the middle, and stuff about like taking off and landing can change and vary, and it's environmentally situational, and things like that. A lot of the coaching techniques are very similar. So things like popping up the hip stuff has come up a couple of times. A lot of people have given very consistent answers about, you know, learning the movement, being challenging, its potentially an intimidating movement. So it's been really interesting. Seeing that actually, even learning from different sources. And different, being in different, different geographic locations. These things have stayed pretty consistent. And this is why I've started asking people about guidelines and things because, as you say, it seems like it already is kind of happening, just not written down anywhere.",781,162
7,127,participant,"Yeah, it's, it's just nonverbal right now, huh? Yeah, it's not explicitly stated. But for sure, I think that anyone who knows can see when, when like, a person's technique is good or bad or otherwise. Mm-mm.",155,38
7,128,interviewer,"Is, um, is there anything about the Kong vault that you'd be curious to find out for yourself?",73,18
7,129,participant,Um...,2,1
7,130,interviewer,"It's okay, if the answer's no, by the way",29,9
7,131,participant,"I do, I do have some, um, so I guess... What differentiating factors make a person like [name] or [name] just fly on their Kong vault, it's like, I have pretty good technique. But like, they go like thirty feet, four feet further than me, like, how's that even possible? You know, so, stuff like that, like how they are just able to go on, like disgusting distances. That's super impressive to me. Um, also, I would like to know about, um, I guess the different optimal acceleration, like, I know, by feel that you don't want to sprint but you want to go hard enough. And then you want to almost sprint as you're taking off. But I want to see if there's, you know, more of a consensus on what the optimal running speed and the optimal running like height because you do have to dip, you know, whether it's better to start up and dip fast or start already a little dipped and then run in, um, those different like, approach sort of things. And I've seen many different people do different things. I've seen people kong further than me running hunched over, you know, sprinting at a wall, and I've seen people you know, Kong way further than me and almost not dip at all. So, I want to see, um, you know, what, is the better way and if it's based on your know your body, the person who did it, who really really dipped was a lot shorter. The person who barely dipped was super tall. I don't know if that plays a factor in dipping height with Kongs. Um, what else um, I guess I know pretty much about where you want to take off optimally for your kongs. Maybe maybe optimising rail kong technique with the pull, you know? How to, like make sure that you can always compensate. I think a lot of the time it's um, I guess a lot of the time it's really just having the balls to go at it really hard. And that's comfort but if there are specific techniques, because first standing Kong I learned this one technique, my friend was like, oh the people in England figured this out and like I've never heard anybody do this in America was like you put your chest to the bar, and then sink back and then go for the standing rail kong. Which kind of-",1641,409
7,132,interviewer,Like a countermovement jump.,24,4
7,133,participant,"Yeah, like you, like you do like a little like, you go up close, and then you sink down. And it's almost like a tendon rebound take off, which I've never seen before that. So yeah, like there's different things like, like those but really the how how the heck did the top athletes do it? And what's the best way to run it a wall? Upright or hunched?",265,69
7,134,interviewer,"Do you have any like, theories about what might what might make people like, I think you said [name], I presume, right, just fly, like...",102,25
7,135,participant,Absolute ability to use all of his strength.,36,8
7,136,interviewer,Hmm.,3,1
7,137,participant,"Um, I think that's another thing that I've meant that I've noticed like some, like [name] does is he has no fear sprinting, like really really hard at things. And I would, and I've seen [name] run really are the things too. Also [name] kind of runs like a gorilla, like he really hunches his shoulders a lot, as he's coming at it, which may add for increased range of motion from like, here to here. So that might have to do with it. Um, probably pushes really hard, um, he might just have a really good body composition for like, pushing and getting distance and like, based on the techniques, it's, it's hard to say, Yeah, but um, but I would guess that it's those and also just tonnes and tonnes of confidence with them.",551,136
7,138,interviewer,Hmm.,3,1
7,139,participant,I think that that's a huge factor always.,32,8
7,140,interviewer,"Yeah. I,um, actually something you said reminded me something I forgot got to ask, which was about strength, because you mentioned the strength. It, does strength play a role? Like if you're stronger in the upper body? For example, can you push further on it?",203,46
7,141,participant,"I would say I would say no, um, the upper body, the push and the strength of it is, is a factor a little bit. Like if you don't have strength, you should get some strength, but the upper body strength and a Kong vault will probably be diminishing returns. Because, um, you know, it is more so from technique and aggression and, like power and takeoff. You know, I think that um, just practising the vault itself will give your arms the strength that they need to perform it well. Um, training plyos and different stuff with your legs will get your legs ready to do the Kong, I think yeah, it's, it's a power move, you know, when you're going for distance. And you could essentially, Kong, kong pre, I would say most people can kong pre two to three feet less than their standing precision. You know, they say that you can kong pre what you're standing precision is. And I know like one person who can do that. Yes, if you have all of your strength and you go all out. Yes, but most people aren't doing that. So I would say two to three feet less is feasible. Mm",817,204
7,142,interviewer,Cool.,4,1
7,143,participant,Yeah.,4,1
7,144,interviewer,"I'm aware of the time, I don't want to monopolise too much of your afternoon. Is there, we've kind of hit all the main points I like to try and get to with people. Is there anything else that you know has popped into your head or you thought of at any point that we didn't get to that you might like to add?",235,64
7,145,participant,"Well, there's always new types of Kongs coming out. Like there's lots of new ways that people are doing them like have you ever seen the cat back Kong? I love that move, like people are in cat. And they like push off the wall turn, throw their hips like 20 feet up. And-",207,54
7,146,interviewer,"Okay. Yes, I know what you mean.",23,7
7,147,participant,"That's a technique, I want to learn how to do better. Like that's one that I've seen, it seems super impressive. And that's a really, really cool application of the Kong vault. Um, I just wanted to add that, you know, in case um, but I don't necessarily even know the technique for that one. Like, that would be something that I would have to ask a friend about, you know.",283,71
7,148,interviewer,"I guess with that kind of movement, that's where I get really interested about like, why is that still a kong when it's so different to everything else?",120,28
7,149,participant,"Because the hands, it's the hands and torso.",34,8
7,150,interviewer,[overlap] Because the hands.,22,4
7,151,participant,"Exactly. Like as long as your hands are in that position. You're diving at something your hands are in that position. And then, hmm, here's something, yeah, so the hands in a lot of Kongs, like a kong like that, or like a dive kong. Like where you're not going for distance, your hands changing from like this diving position to an upright position. Like it kind of um, I don't know the exact physics, but it is some kind of physics mechanism that like changes the position of your body. Um, so as long as you're diving, your hands touch and then the position of your body changes. It's a kong.",458,112
7,152,interviewer,Right.,5,1
7,153,participant,And then your momentum is carrying through.,36,7
7,154,interviewer,"Yeah. I guess in that case, the things that change around it depend on your goal in that moment, you know. Are you trying to get distance to land on something far away? Or are you just trying to get over the wall? Because you've just done a cat back...?",193,50
7,155,participant,"Exactly. Exactly. Um, yeah, that's a very interesting way that people will kong. I also want to mention that, have you ever seen [name] video of [name] doing the Kong front, like 30 feet out into the water? And that video in some way [unclear]",184,45
7,156,interviewer,"Yeah, yeah. Yeah.",12,3
7,157,participant,"I wanna, I want to mention that Kong as something that is immaculate, but also that doing the kong front, theoretically, is the most powerful way to do, to do a Kong.",129,32
7,158,interviewer,Really.,6,1
7,159,participant,"Because here's the thing is that when you do a kong precision, that change in body direction, happens, like you go from here to here. In a koong front, you go from here, to just rotating over. And there doesn't have to be like any change, like from this, so you just go. And you can fling yourself like, obviously, it's less controlled. But it's the, it is more powerful, like you can just completely throw yourself and have no resistance. So if there was ever like some sort of competition, or something where people were going for straight up vault power, like, like a long jump competition, probably kong fronts would eventually become the best technique for vaulting over something and going as far as you can.",562,128
7,160,interviewer,"Interesting. So that's because you're not kind of... yeah, as you say, you're not trying to get the chest back up. You just keep going with the dive.",111,28
7,161,participant,Yeah. [unclear] Allowing yourself to rotate.,35,6
7,162,interviewer,Do you think the upper body is still doing anything in that kind of vault? Or do you think it's just tapping the wall as you dive over?,105,28
7,163,participant,"Pushing. It's, all all that it's doing is pushing and giving you a little bit more.",63,16
7,164,interviewer,Mm.,2,1
7,165,participant,"Mmhmm. You're putting your, you basically are probably using your arms so that you know your head doesn't hit and so that you can clear and get as much you know, oomph as possible, you're still probably konging in a very close to a kong position. So your arms are still doing that. But then on your exit, you're just allowing your hips to keep on rising so that you rotate around.",297,72
7,166,interviewer,"Hmm. Interesting, I'm gonna have to go back and watch that video as well as the blue shorts one.",74,19
7,167,participant,"Yeah, you can analyse those videos that have, I feel like they'll show you a whole tonne about, you know what the Kong is all about. And what optimal technique for different things is. Yeah.",149,35
7,168,interviewer,"Cool. Okay, yeah. Is there anything else you want to throw in?",47,12
7,169,participant,"Is there anything else? I think that hits about all of it that I want to that I want to add. Um, yeah, that's about it. Um, this is this is cool. I've never, I've never really fleshed out all of the technique, you know, for to another advanced practitioner who wants to understand it like this, because I normally as a coach, I'm administering this information in small doses to people so that they can grasp all of it. But um, but yeah, this was this was very cool. Very interesting in that way.",381,95
7,170,interviewer,"I'm glad. It's something I've I've kind of seen in a couple of people I've been talking to where they know it, but they've never had to verbalise it. And so you can almost see them as they're putting the words in order in their head going, Yeah, okay. I knew this, but I hadn't ever, like expressed it in this way before.",242,63
7,171,participant,"Haven't fully walked somebody through the process from beginning to end. Like that. Yeah. So I think that like what you were doing by like, kind of asking the questions to guide like, what's the step? What's that step? What's that step? What's that step? That really helps somebody really process what where exactly like the next move is in what needs to be considered. Oh, yeah, it was a cool experience.",316,72
7,172,interviewer,"Good. I'm glad. I'll um, I'll stop the recording. In that case, just bear with me a second.",65,18
8,1,interviewer,"Okay, there we go. So, yeah, so the study is just really looking to talk to parkour coaches about how they understand the movements that we do in parkour, how they've kind of learned it, how they coach it to others, given that, you know, Parkour is kind of a decentralised sport, there's not like one central place where everyone comes and learns it or something like that, kind of spread around the world. And I just picked Kong vault as quite a well known movement, you know, to start with, I guess the first thing to kind of check with you then is, is the term Kong familiar to you? Is that the term that you use to describe it?",491,121
8,2,participant,"Yes. Yeah, we actually use Kong, cat and similar, things like that. But sometimes in English, sometimes it German, depends on who we're talking to.",114,25
8,3,interviewer,"What, have you noticed any particular, when you it say depends on who you're talking to, anyone in particular uses one or the other? Or it's all just interchangable?",130,29
8,4,participant,"Most of the time, people who train with other people from other countries, they say Kong vault, but people who only the train in Austria, and most of the time, most of the time, just say cat, or catpass. Because in German we just say katze. And that's pretty much the same movement.",219,53
8,5,interviewer,"Right? Interesting. Is, um, how do you how do you spell that for the German? Because I've not heard it in German before.",91,23
8,6,participant,"K, a, t, z, e.",5,5
8,7,interviewer,And is that just a cat? Or?,19,7
8,8,participant,Yes.,3,1
8,9,interviewer,"That's cool. I've spoken to a whole bunch of people, and they've all you know, usually used one or the other, but it's tended to still be the English word, regardless of what, where they've got it from, like Kong and catpass, basically. So it's interesting to hear that in German, German, in Austria. So it's Austria, yeah?",245,58
8,10,participant,Yeah.,4,1
8,11,interviewer,"That, actually, you just use a German word for it entirely. That's really cool. And like, just as a broad place to start, how would you describe the Kong or catpass?",127,31
8,12,participant,"I would say it's a pretty basic movement to overcome an obstacle. Like you place your hands onto it, you push off the obstacle, then you fly over it, and just pass it.",129,33
8,13,interviewer,"Is there any more detail? If you're going to break it down for like someone who you are coaching, how would you describe it?",97,24
8,14,participant,"If I break it down there's different parts of the movement. First, you get the jump off with, in the beginning, we usually use the normal stance like two feet together, because it's easier. And then if you get there, you just use the split stance. So I have the right foot in front and left one a bit back. Then you have the arm swing and the dip, which happen at the same time, I would say, right after you get the stance, you get the dip and the arm swing onto the obstacle. And then you have to push off, and the pull, I would say, I usually separate into two parts. It's like you push off an obstacle and the same time you pull back so you can actually get your chest up and get a bit more distance over the obstacle. And then you have to normal phase in the air, where you're just preparing for the landing and trying to focus on the landing. Then you have your landing phase where you try to get your feet in front of you, you have your arms in the back and you have an upright posture. So you can spot the landing and then just stick it.",807,210
8,15,interviewer,"Lots of good stuff in there. When you take it right back then to the beginning with the takeoff, you mentioned you know having a two foot pu-, two foot jump or a split step jump, split foot takeoff. How does, why would you use one or the other and how they kind of affect the movement?",221,57
8,16,participant,"Usually when I tried to do quite far Kong vault, kong pre, I use a split stance which is I would say easier to get some distance in. If I try to do high Kong like high wall onto another high wall. Then try to do to use the punch stance, because you can get more energy into the ground, but it's a bit more demanding on the legs. And that's why we usually use a split stance because it's less less demanding. But it's a bit more technical, I would say. So you start with the hard one on the muscles, but easy on technique, then as we get better we change it up. So you get actually both.",449,120
8,17,interviewer,"So does the split foot one, you mentioned it helps you get distance, so is it kind of easier to transfer to keep your horizontal speed?",107,26
8,18,participant,"I would say so because if you use a split step, you can actually lean forward a bit more. And this you have more horizontal force which you can transfer into the jump, as the same as the dive roll, if you try to do the dive roll into the distance, you use a split stance and not a punch.",222,60
8,19,interviewer,"So the punch with two feet, its kind of turning it a little bit more into a jump so you can get a bit more height rather than just kind of carrying you smoothly forward from your running?",148,38
8,20,participant,"I would say so yes. Okay. Most of the time, in the beginning, it's easier, because people have some coordination problems with the arms and everything. And then we try to do it as easy as possible. That's why I tried to start with the easy leg variation, and change it up.",210,52
8,21,interviewer,So then moving on to you mentioned the arm swing and kind of happen at the same time. What are they? What are they doing? What are they contributing to the movement?,130,32
8,22,participant,"I would say we have to get down on to roughly the same level as the wall. So we can actually push ourselves up. Because if you're too high, you can't use your arms, just touch it with your fingers. We use it to, you can actually get upright posture. Because if you go down, you come back up, you get an upright posture with your chest, and you have an easier time pushing yourself off the wall. And it's more like pre-stretching your muscles. And then you can actually use more force in the jump.",384,97
8,23,interviewer,So it's it's like any other jump really you go down to come back up with more power.,64,18
8,24,participant,"Kinda like the counter movement jump because we get first go down and then come back up. So you can preload muscles get to stretch, stretch reflex and bounce out of it.",134,32
8,25,interviewer,"And the arm swing, is that an important part, is that just something that people do?",66,16
8,26,participant,"I think it adds a little bit of velocity into the horizontal plane. Because if you have your arms in front all time, you have hard time pushing yourself off. Because if you swing back and back, and then you come back forth, its the same pattern pairs with the legs, try to stretch it first, and then you come up.",244,61
8,27,interviewer,"So the arms are coming behind you as you're running up, and then being swept forward-",67,16
8,28,participant,On the last step.,13,4
8,29,interviewer,-in front of you. On the last step.,25,8
8,30,participant,"On the last step. So when you dip, have your arms back and then when you jump you get them in the front and then try to push and pull yourself over the wall.",121,34
8,31,interviewer,"Okay. Are they, are they throwing your weight forward a little bit as well for the dive?",69,17
8,32,participant,"Not completely in front of yourself, but more like onto the wall.",52,12
8,33,interviewer,"Okay. And then pull and the push you talk about,o that's with the hands on the obstacle? And they're pushing, pushing first?",96,23
8,34,participant,"Yes, so normally, I learned like you just push yourself off when you get all distance from your run up. But I noticed over the years that if I tried to do a pretty big Kong, usually try to pull a bit with the arms and helps with getting up. And I usually saw this also when some people tried to do Kong over rail. So they're not, they just don't push off they grab the rail, push and pull at the same time. And this way, they can get a bit more distance, a bit more upright.",363,98
8,35,interviewer,So that pull is is sweeping the arms back down. Almost the reverse of what we just talked about. They're coming back down to behind you almost to propel you forward off the obstacle a bit?,149,36
8,36,participant,Yes.,3,1
8,37,interviewer,Is that contributing a lot to the distance you get off the obstacle or just a bit?,65,17
8,38,participant,"Just a little bit. I think it would contribute more to the posture features. Because if you pull yourself up, you have a better a time flying.",112,27
8,39,interviewer,"So that that posture you're trying to get, I guess so as you've dived on to the obstacle, your chest has come down, you're trying to get yourself back upright in the air?",131,33
8,40,participant,"Yeah. Because if you're too far forward, you have no space between yourself and the wall or not enough space to get the legs through. So you try and get yourself up, then you have your legs in front, and it's easier to get them in position for your landing.",200,50
8,41,interviewer,"Okay. And so when it comes to landings, are there kind of particular ways that you're trying to land the movement, same as there's like, the various ways to takeoff that you talked about? Are there similar ways to learn?",173,40
8,42,participant,"I would say it's pretty much the normal pre technique. So you try to land on the ball of your feet, trying to have your legs in front of yourself or in front of the hips. So when you land you still have some force, carrying you over to the landing, and trying to avoid your heel or your mid foot, so you don't crash into the wall, so that you have controlled landing technique.",293,75
8,43,interviewer,"So that's landing with two feet together, coming to a stop?",46,11
8,44,participant,"Normally, yes, if you want to stick it, if you want to continue, you don't lean back as much as you keep your posture more upright. So you have some forward momentum at landing. And you can continue with the movement.",169,41
8,45,interviewer,Do you ever land like on one foot or in other positions?,44,12
8,46,participant,"Sometimes it kong straight, do a stride out of it, or flip maybe, like, if you land and trying to do webster straight out of it, you have to change up the chest posture and the landing technique quite a bit. But if you're talking about the normal kong pre, just have both feet in front of you, trying to stick it, if you're trying to do a stride you're to trying to get more of an upright, more body posture. So you don't crash down [unclear]",339,87
8,47,interviewer,"I mean, it's interesting, you use the word normal. Because that's kind of the thing I'm talking to people about is like, there's a lot of things you can change. I mean, even in this, you know, there's multiple ways you can take off, you can land in different ways. What, what do you kind of think is it that makes something a Kong vault? What, when you can change so much to do, you know, I mean, what's kind of like the core of the movement?",333,87
8,48,participant,"Um, I think it's important that you take off especially with two legs, but you can do it with one leg, you have... it kind of looks like the movement of a cat, when it passes something. So you have your arms in front of you, you prep, er, try to propel yourself over the wall, and try to land it. And the landing can vary depending on where you're landing, which surface, what you're doing afterwards. So I think important is the jump is with a, with everything forwards, arms on some obstacle, legs pass through, and then landing.",408,100
8,49,interviewer,"So the kind of, the part on the obstacle is kind of the thing that you go that that's what makes it a kong. And the stuff around it kind of can change depending on the environment that you're in, or the goals of the person?",172,46
8,50,participant,"Yes. Depending on what you want to do and what you want to accomplish. Because you can do a dive kong. There you have different jumping technique you can do. Even if you just do a kong, a wall, which is higher then you have to change up the jump and the run up, but the same patterns, always two hands on the wall, trying to push yourself off.",265,69
8,51,interviewer,Do you think that there's something unique or useful about that type of movement pattern? That means it's something that people like to use?,113,24
8,52,participant,"I think some people like to compare to monkey style. Monkeys try to use it all the time. And I think it's one of the best ways to transfer force onto the wall or into the wall. So you lose, don't lose too much energy by travelling over it. Because sometimes if you try to use step through or something like that, you you can't get all the energy into the wall, because I think techniques quite hard to actually get a lot of the energy you have from the run up onto the wall to use it in a dash or speed step or something like that. I think the Kong is just this basic movement, which was, well, you quite, use quite a lot in the beginning of parkour. That's why everybody's trying to use it and perfect it. So it's like call it, um standard jump everybody wants to do, is just like a backflip. Everybody knows Okay, parkour, do backflips, parkour they're doing Kong vaults, is just a basic movement.",697,174
8,53,interviewer,"Right, kind of quite a classic parkour movement, would you say? It's, is it something that, you know, you've kind of maybe already answered this, but it's something that people should, if they come to learn Parkour they should expect to learn to do this, or, it's kind of like a fundamental movement?",233,53
8,54,participant,"I would say so because you can get quite a variation of this movement. And it's always good to have it in your repertoire. Because if you're trying to kong gainer, kong front, kong side, 360 Kongs, and stuff like that, you have always have to get have a good kong, otherwise, you will always lack the push and transfer over the wall. And you can't get the next trick out of it. Because even if you just want to do some flips, see sometimes need to do a kong over something to get to the next part of the line. And it's way better to have a good kong, because you get more energy more force out of it than doing a shitty Kong something or something.",502,128
8,55,interviewer,"So that, that energy and force idea that you also mentioned before, is that helping you to keep your speed so that you're you're staying fast on the other side of the obstacle as well? Or is it about getting distance off the vault? What, what are you trying to keep your energy or produce force for?",235,57
8,56,participant,"I would say if you tried to do a pretty far Kong, you have to use quite some force into the horizontal plane. And that you can generate with run. And then it's important that you have a good push off technique. Otherwise, you're too fast, and you might smash into the wall. That's when it's important to have a good push off. So you don't have to slow down on your run up. So you can actually use the run up as a way to generate force to get over the wall. And then do whatever you want to do after that.",386,103
8,57,interviewer,"Compared to maybe some of the other vaults that we commonly use in parkour does it, does it have any like pros and cons? Are there stuff that its good for and stuff that its bad for?",143,37
8,58,participant,"I would say it's not if you trying to do a flow line, it's not that useful, I would say there are other ways which like are more fluid like to step through or dash, they like more like, like a flow movement. But with the Kong, it's more like I would say power movement, or otherwise, because you always have to get yourself some distance over the wall. Because if you just get too close, but on the landing to the wall, you might get fling yourself back into the wall. With other movements, you don't have same problem because if you're doing a sped step, you have one arm, one leg on the wall and you just step down, if you're doing a dash, you're already over the wall after you push off. So there's no there's no hesitation for next movement I would say. And I would say the pros is like keeping yourself, keeping the pace and getting some distance in with less technical aspects.",685,169
8,59,interviewer,"So with the flow movements, it gives you... it maybe has a little bit less control than the others because you have to, because of that power input? Or because you can stay in contact with the wall longer, than the other vaults?",178,43
8,60,participant,"I wouldn't say it's a control thing. I'd rather say it's it's more of the space you need for the movement. Because if you look at some movements in which, a very small speed step, you just have the wall and a few centimetres off that. But if you're doing a kong, you need the space in front of the wall for the jump, you need the wall itself. And you need some space after that for the landing, because you won't have the time if you jump, you're trying to get close to the wall, doing a dash Kong combination or first kong and then dash down, so you can close to the wall. Otherwise, you might have to fly some distance that use a lot of space for this movement. So if you have a lot of space, that's good. But if you have a small area to train in, and we do some flow, when you have to kong and you already use half the space. It won't be, it won't look good I would say.",662,179
8,61,interviewer,"How did you, how did you learn the movement for yourself? Were you self taught? Or do you go to classes or anything like that?",98,25
8,62,participant,"I think about 11 years ago, I started parkour. And the beginning I took classes, and they taught it with this normal technique, you stand in front of the box, you have your hands on the box to jump. And when you're young, you push yourself up. So you get your feet onto the box, then you try it with a little bit of speed trying to do same thing again, jump, push off, land on the box. And with time you progress, get it a little bit more speed and push yourself over the wall. It's pretty much how I learned then I progressed from there.",414,107
8,63,interviewer,"Where, who was running those classes, was it a group or just to a single coach?",61,16
8,64,participant,"There were two coaches, and one of them was the a tricker and the other one was a freerunner. And both of them trained the basics with us. And then you if you want to flip or more tricking, you do with one of them. But the basics, both of them have them down. So no problem there.",215,58
8,65,interviewer,Could you give me their names or the name of the group if they had like a group name or anything?,76,21
8,66,participant,"They had a group but the group split up a few years ago, but their name were get [name] and [name].",73,21
8,67,interviewer,"Thank you. It's, it's just one of the things I'm looking at is, where people have learned from and seeing if they connect up, or if it's just kind of spread around. Cool. Did you, okay, so you were learning at  these classes, did you find it easy to learn or difficult to learn? How did you get on with it?",230,61
8,68,participant,"I had some problems in the beginning because we're, in the beginning, the first movement, just jumping and pushing myself up onto the box wasn't that hard. But after that, just running on to the obstacle with more and more speed was a bit of a mental challenge. I think some kids still have this problem. When I teach it in some schools or something like that. There's some kids that will respond to it. And they'll just kong over it no problem. And other kids, they can't run up properly, because they have this mental barrier. And then I try to get the for, the run up as late as possible. Because you can get quite a bit of the push and the pull. If you have this down, the run up doesn't have to be that fast to get to get to have a good distance out of it. Then it becomes secondary, I would say then it's easier for these kids with these mental barriers to get over it.",677,172
8,69,interviewer,What do you think causes that mental barrier?,37,8
8,70,participant,"I think it's this just running straight into something hard. Like if you have a brick wall or anything, it's just like you have to run up into something which is way harder than you and it can hurt you quite a bit.",167,43
8,71,interviewer,"Do you find that with other vaults, though, or is it something that the kong vault in particular is more scary than the others?",101,24
8,72,participant,"I think with this speed step I didn't have the same problem, but with the dash because if you get too long with the dash you just hit your butt on the on the edge of the wall. It doesn't feel that good.",155,43
8,73,interviewer,"Yeah. So movements where you have to kind of jump at the wall a bit, and being in midair a little bit rather than always having like an arm or a leg in contact?",124,34
8,74,participant,Yes.,3,1
8,75,interviewer,"Yeah, I was the same. The Kong was the scariest vault for me to learn when I was learning. I remember that. And how about now? Is it an easy movement for you now? Is it something you enjoy? Or is it still one that you find challenging or anything like that?",198,52
8,76,participant,"Actually not, right now the Kong is my main movement, I would say, because if I'm finding challenges, most of them are kong challenges. And what helped quite a bit was doing really low kong like knee height kongs, because you don't have the same mental barrier. Because you just step over the wall if you don't make it. And you have quite a good technique challenge. Because if you want to get some distance out of it, you have to get the proper technique. Otherwise, you're just jumping over it and touching the wall. I think that helped quite a bit. Because when it came back to high walls, they felt way better. And they got much more distance with less. And right now I'm trying to do as many kongs as possible trying to get these big kong pres.",586,141
8,77,interviewer,So is that training your push and pull on those lower obstacles?,52,12
8,78,participant,I would say so yes.,14,5
8,79,interviewer,Rather than getting like a huge run up and getting all your power from that?,61,15
8,80,participant,"Mmhmm. Because I was thinking if I get the proper technique on to, on the wall itself, the run up is just in addition to the force I can generate, because if I can maximise my technique on the wall, I have less risk of injury. And we can just get additional force out of the run up. So I don't have to rely on on the run up to get all my force out of it.",269,77
8,81,interviewer,"So when you when you started to move into coaching, did you find that you had to change anything about how you understood the movement? Or update it? Or anything like that? Or are you teaching it now, kind of how you learned it back then?",187,46
8,82,participant,"Sometimes it depends on the classes, if I have some kids, some kids which are doing the push pull by themselves without telling them, I don't have to coach it because they already doing it. But sometimes I see people which are just pushing, then have to mention it because they never learned it, might have learned the same way I did. When I started coaching, I try to think about the movements quite a lot. Because I wanted to see how it felt and trying to do trying to get the whole feeling back into training. So if I have something like this push pull, I would say if I do this, and then never tell the kids then some of them might feel it themselves. Some of them don't. So if I try to tell them alright, we're going to do it standing onto the floor. And they just push, they're landing between their hands. If I tried to like try to pull yourself in front of yourself and get your legs in front of your feet in front of the hands. Then you have the same technique on the wall and they have a much easier time getting it.",801,202
8,83,interviewer,"Are there any any like common things that you look out for when people, when you're coaching people to say like Yes, that was a good Kong or that was a bad one? How you kind of assessing performance of it?",160,41
8,84,participant,"Normally I would say if I see their hips rising quite high, so I have this like you u-shape in the air. That's not a normal kong or not a good one. I would say for normal pre because you get quite a lean forward and you might fall and I would say good kongs when they they look safe in the air. When you look at them, you watch them int he air and they just look safe and don't have this like arched position. Trying to not fall on the ass so it's usually depends on the person. If they look safe in the air, it's good. The rest, I would say style. If they have this, pointy toes or more forward, depends on the person.",473,129
8,85,interviewer,"Does that kind of ability to assess it for safety just come from experience as a coach, just seeing what people do it and getting a feel for the movement?",123,30
8,86,participant,"I would say so because some kids, they, they move different than others. And if you watch them move normally, and you think then there's something off, but there's nothing off, it just seems a bit off. And this usually transfers into other movements as well. And then you have to just, like, watch them, and try to get this, right, because sometimes they it looks off, but it's all fine. It's just their basic movements. So I would say if you watch them, and you learn, it's just experience.",378,90
8,87,interviewer,"You mentioned about getting the hips too high. Getting the hips up high has been something that other people have mentioned, when I've talked to them about the movement. Is there like, do they have to come up some but you're saying if they come up too much, that's just as bad as not getting them up at all? Or do they need to, they, should they stay below a certain level or anything like that?",308,76
8,88,participant,"It's, I would say in relation to your chest, if your hip gets really high, you just have to get the same height. So if you're just doing a kong if you're doing a double Kong its different, but if you're doing a normal Kong, and you have this parallel position for your chest to the floor, you have to be really flexible to get your feet in front of yourself. Because it's easier, I feel a bit more upwards posture because you don't have to be that flexible, and you have a better time landing, I would say you rise up with your hip and you can still come up with your chest. That's no problem at all. But if your hip comes up, and your chest stays down, you can either try to get your feet up,  and do a double Kong, or you can try to roll because if you come up like this, you have a your feet here, you stick it in then just fall forward.",642,171
8,89,interviewer,"So they do need to rise up a bit, just you know, because you're coming up over an obstacle, but you don't want to get like right up into like a handstand kind of thing.",128,35
8,90,participant,"As they can just do a kong front at that point, if they come up and just push like this to do kong front, it's easier.",89,26
8,91,interviewer,"Is it, is it a movement that you found people like new, newcomers to classes or, for example, they already know what a Kong is, and they want to learn it? Or do they recognise it from outside of parkour?",157,40
8,92,participant,"I think so, especially the kids, if they come to some classes, they've seen videos and stuff like that. And they always try to do a kong sometimes just get the legs beside but most of them try to a kong. They might not know the name, but they know the movement.",202,52
8,93,interviewer,"Its funny, is it you know that they're trying to move out and stuff, is it a natural movement for people to learn do you think? Or is it something invented for parkour?",131,33
8,94,participant,"I don't know actually, because it depends heavily on the person, some people they see to try to do it first time. Other people really have a hard time learning it. I think speed step is the best way more natural than a kong. And a kong is more like, it's more like an animal. It's not more like a human movement, but more like an animal move. That's why some people move alot have an easier time with it, because they already have some moving experience. But people don't move that much usually have a harder time learning, I would say.",417,102
8,95,interviewer,"Is that from a coordination kind of point of view or strength, or both?",56,14
8,96,participant,"I would say it's more like coordination and mental. Because I would say almost everybody has the power to push themselves off a wall. I had some people around the 100 kilogrammes which were able to do a kong vault so if you have kids, there shouldn't be any problem with the power or with to force.",236,57
8,97,interviewer,"Does strength play any role in the movement, like if you're stronger, can you perform it easier or go further or anything like that?",105,24
8,98,participant,Yeah.,4,1
8,99,interviewer,Or is it mostly a technique thing?,27,7
8,100,participant,"I would say if you have more power in your arms, if you're strong in your arms, it's easier because you, you know, you can push yourself off the wall, and you get more distance between yourself to walk in the wall. So you don't have to rely on technique too much to get your feet over the wall. But I would say it's easier to get the technique down and then get the strength. But if you have the strength already, it's easier to learn because you can push yourself up quite hard, then it's easier to get over the wall.",400,102
8,101,interviewer,"I realised actually, I never asked right back in the beginning. What, what kind of obstacles is it used on? Are there things it's particularly well suited for? I know, it's quite a broad question. You know, like, I know, it can be used in all sorts of weird things in parkour, but are there like common common uses for it, common things it's used on?",269,66
8,102,participant,"I would say, the normal kong is performed on the, on a wall, which is about two hands wide. So you don't have to worry about too much about the hand placement. Normally, if you see a pretty big kong, it's about, it's done over a wall. Rail kongs are common too, but they're way harder, because you have to grab the rail, it's easier, it's more risky. And usually just do it over one and try to land on another one or something like that.",331,86
8,103,interviewer,"Are rails just riskier, just because there are a smaller surface, you're just more likely to miss it?",80,18
8,104,participant,"Mmhmm. Harder to get it the technique down or not the technique, but more like the coordination, when you actually trt to grab it. Because you have a wall, you have more space, you just slap your heads onto it. And if it's not a really small wall, you're gonna hit it. So you don't have to worry about too much about missing hands.",255,64
8,105,interviewer,"And with rails, you know, you can't presumably get the hand flat on top either. Does that change the movement as well, like the push and pull that you mentioned?",126,30
8,106,participant,"I would say just a bit, but more like a feeling change. The technique itself won't change too much just a bit. Because you actually grab the rail, I would say, because most people try to grab it. So you get to get them by grabbing it. You can't push yourself off as fast as off a wall. So you actually have to have a little less speed on to it. Because you have you need more time to get yourself over the rail than over the wall.",331,88
8,107,interviewer,"Are they, as well as being more technically challenging on a rail. Are they scarier as a result?",76,18
8,108,participant,Yes. Yes.,6,2
8,109,interviewer,"Okay, so coming back to coaching a little bit. You know, so you're your coach with ATG parkour? Is that right?",84,21
8,110,participant,"Oh, yeah.",6,2
8,111,interviewer,Yeah.,4,1
8,112,participant,"ATG is more like it's like a, I don't know, the English word for it, but it's different sports under one organisation. So you have like, different trainers for different sports, running, gymnastics, water sports, track and field and there's one part which is parkour.",209,45
8,113,interviewer,Okay.,4,1
8,114,participant,"So, ATG is for [unclear], which is just a general movement organisation, I would say.",65,15
8,115,interviewer,"Oh, interesting. That's cool. I was gonna ask then, do you... are there other parkour coaches as part of that as well? Or is it just you?",101,27
8,116,participant,"Um, there was another one, which was teaching as well, but he got too busy with work. So he had to stop doing the classes and I over took, now I'm teaching his class too.",129,35
8,117,interviewer,"The thing I'm curious about is whether when coaches work in like, organisations or groups, whether they talk about how they coach the skills or whether there's like an agreed agreement on how they're going to coach you, or whether it's just all down to the individual coach and their experience. So I don't know if you if that's something you used to do, or you do now, but with coaches from other sports, do you talk about coaching and how you do it?",354,84
8,118,participant,"Sometimes I talk to the gymnast, gymnastics coach, because we have quite a few of them, and some track and field coaches and stuff like that. Because they sometimes have quite similar movements. And they tried to teach and try to teach in a quite similar way, just with a little twist specific to their own sport. And you can always learn something from them. You don't have to take the complete concept and teach it like this. But you can always get something from them. Right now we're trying to make our own little parkour organisation, I would say, there are like five or six trainers in there. And we're talking about how we teach something, and why we think it's good to teach it like this. Because we might have some difference in approach, because if I teach a backflip different to someone else, we talk about it and he says, like, I have good experience with going over the shoulder. I say I never tried it that way. And then we try to get best, the best of both worlds. Try to complete like combined, and it's the same for the Kong.",819,195
8,119,interviewer,Have you found with the Kong vault in particular that there have been differences in approach or do people tend to teach it the same way?,111,26
8,120,participant,"The main problem here  in my city is most of the people have learned from the same five to six people. So it's pretty much the same. That's the same as Austria because we have a few people who started like 15 years ago, they started the first trainer courses and they learned from them from there and spread so it's pretty much the same in Austria.",274,67
8,121,interviewer,"Okay, that's really interesting. How about you know, I've seen you've got the parkour UK level one qualification?",89,18
8,122,participant,"Um, no, I have something different. Have you talked to someone else from Austria?",64,14
8,123,interviewer,"Uhh... yes, you're right. I've written that down for the wrong person. You've got the BSPA instructor?",76,17
8,124,participant,"Yes, BSPAs are, like it's a nation wide organisation which is responsible for training courses and training classes, for different sports, there are like big organisation, they have different people for different sports. And then you have the different levels of coaches. With the beginning. It's like an instructor, it's the lowest level, no [unclear], which is the lowest level then you have the instructor then you have the trainer and then I dunno, [unclear], I don't know if the same word because you have...",405,85
8,125,interviewer,Like a master trainer or something like that?,37,8
8,126,participant,"Yeah, something like that. It's on the same level as master's degree in sports science.",68,15
8,127,interviewer,"Oh, wow.",5,2
8,128,participant,"They have the different levels. They have the instructor right now, and trying to get a trainer course for parkour, which is on the same level as the bachelor bachelor's degree of sports science I would say.",166,37
8,129,interviewer,"Wow, cool. That's cool. I don't think I've heard of a parkour specific qualification at that level. yet. I think that's the first one I've heard about.",114,27
8,130,participant,Because here some people are actually quite motivated to get the sport going in Austria. Maybe you know one of them. [name]?,98,22
8,131,interviewer,Oh yes. I don't know her but I know the name. Yeah.,36,12
8,132,participant,"Because she's very motivated and trying to get these courses running so more people can get some qualification and actually know what they're teaching. Because there are a lot of people in Austria who are teaching parkour and never done parkour. We have like, five or six courses and only two people of them have some qualifications, all the other people are like ah I saw it on the internet. Or are ex-gymnastics, trying to teach it.",348,78
8,133,interviewer,"So I'm really curious with the instructor qualification, then did that include, you know, this is how you teach a Kong vault, or this is what a Kong vault is, was that in the course, or was it just like expected that you'd know that from your own background?",201,49
8,134,participant,"It wasn't expected, it was in the part before in the [unclear], which is the primary or the base. And then you in the instructor you have more like, a bit more challenging moves like variations of the common flips. And you have basic strength training, stuff like that, how to increase the strength specific for parkour and stuff like that. Overall, and the specific part for the course.",306,69
8,135,interviewer,So was that actually teaching you how to do the movement or how to coach the movement?,69,17
8,136,participant,"Its, normally, you have an entrance exam. So you have to know how to do it yourself. The movements, which is just a physical examination, I would say, you come there, they're like, ah, do this, this and this, and you do the things. And they're like, good, you're good to go. And then you get to, you get taught how to teach it. Because you have to do have some level of skill, but they teach you how to teach it.",308,82
8,137,interviewer,Were you already coaching before you took the qualification? Or do you do the qualification first and then start coaching?,101,20
8,138,participant,I was teaching beforehand.,22,4
8,139,interviewer,And how's it-,9,3
8,140,participant,If there's like-,12,3
8,141,interviewer,Sorry.,5,1
8,142,participant,"And I just wanted to say, because my old trainer, he taught me how to teach these things, and how to spot them. And then after he stopped doing courses, I just overtook them for him and started this.",155,39
8,143,interviewer,"And how did you find like, your own experience and the stuff he developed or the stuff you learned from your trainer before, for teaching the Kong vault, how did that compare to the stuff being taught in the course? Was it very similar? Or did you find this very different?",217,51
8,144,participant,"It was pretty much the same, because the guy who was the teacher there was the same teacher for my trainer. But it wasn't, it was a bit more developed, because there was like a time period of five to six years between these two courses. And that's in the beginning was more like this hero movement, you just push yourself off, you fly and the land. With time, they learn new things, and they adapted it in their courses.",328,80
8,145,interviewer,This is kind of over time become a bit more refined rather than changed completely.,68,15
8,146,participant,"Yes. I would say it's the same as for strength training parkour. Years go, nobody was doing it. Except for some pros. And I've seen some changes now, especially with [names] and people like that. We're trying to get the idea of parkour specific strength training to the people. So more and more people starting, I would say it's the same because a few years ago was like, You lift heavy, you can better, that's it. And now you have more and more information about why you lift heavy, why you sometimes lift, not too heavy, and you still get better.",424,101
8,147,interviewer,"That's really interesting. I didn't realise that the BSPA thing that you mentioned in the form when you filled it out was was to that kind of.. yeah, that kind of level going right up to to degree kind of level instruction in parkour specifically. That's really interesting.",218,48
8,148,participant,"For parkour right now, there isn't the highest education level available, because they're not enough money. Not enough people right now for this course. So we are right now with instructor and there's this trainer course which is, which is being planned right now. And I think it should start next year or something like that, or an end of this year, if there are enough participants, because the last level is for coaches who are already coaching international team like Olympics for swimming and stuff like that. That's like the highest level you can get in Austria. That's for the experts.",474,102
8,149,interviewer,"Wow, that's great. Are you involved in putting the courses together? Or are you taking, just taking them as a student?",92,21
8,150,participant,"Right now I'm just taking them at the [unclear]. But for few friends of mine, I do the strength training. And I try to always tell them how I do something. And why do it like that. Because the same is true. If I tell them I do it like this, the Kong? And I tell them why. Most of the time they understand, or if they don't understand or don't agree with it, they tell me why they don't agree then we try to come up with a solution.",324,90
8,151,interviewer,"That's pretty cool. Okay, sorry, I went off on a little bit of a side topic there. That's really cool. So the, you know, we've covered a lot of the points, I like to try and hit with people. Are there, are there any things about the Kong vault that you're curious about, that you want to know more about for yourself? And it's, it's okay, if the answer is no, as well by the way. I don't want to put you on the spot.",308,85
8,152,participant,"I would say it's a lot about the small part over the wall, because the run up and the landing are quite clear, I would say. But sometimes the people who are still teaching like you just push yourself off and the fly. But what about push and try to pull? What is your chest doing? What is their spine doing, what are their legs doing? I think that's an important part, which isn't covered completely yet. So would you be nice to have some more information about that. This short period of time over the wall. What are you doing there? And why are some people better there than others?",456,111
8,153,interviewer,"The kind of what the hands are doing, on the obstacle in the movement?",55,14
8,154,participant,"It's like, the whole body, what's it doing over the wall.",42,11
8,155,interviewer,"Yeah. Is there, is there anything else that you know, you've thought of or might have popped into your head during the conversation that we haven't had a chance to talk about or we didn't get to, that you'd like to add?",169,42
8,156,participant,"Right now the only question I'm having is, how to incorporate strength training to improve your kong vault? Because it's pretty easy, like do push ups or bench press stuff like that. But what about the back? Are they doing especially, especially for the lats, something like that, to get your pull? I think that would be nice to know, if you have some exercises of stuff like that.",300,69
8,157,interviewer,"It'd be quite interesting to see whether, you know, you could correlate someone's back strength, or something. like how and how many pull ups they could do or how much weight they could do and how far they could travel off the kong vault. Something like that.",205,47
8,158,participant,"Maybe something different, because I think the main problem with the pull up, you have to move on from here to here and with the Kong you have it down here, just maybe lat pulldown from from the shoulders down.",167,40
8,159,interviewer,"Yeah, kind of straight arm stuff or even something like a lever.",51,12
8,160,participant,Yeah.,4,1
8,161,interviewer,"Interesting. Okay. Well, yeah, otherwise, you know, like I say, we've gone through all the points I'd like to try and get to people. Yeah, unless there's anything else you want to add. Then I'll stop the recording. And we can we can wrap up.",181,45
8,162,participant,I think I don't have anything more to say right now.,40,11
8,163,interviewer,"Okay, great. Let me just stop the recording.",34,8
9,1,interviewer,"All right, there we go. So, yeah, thank you for coming along. I'm really just looking to talk to kind of parkour coaches around the world, about how they kind of understand some of the movements that we do in parkour considering how it's kind of grown organically and spread throughout the world, but without having like, a rulebook, or like written things that are like, this is what Parkour is, and this is how we do it.",331,78
9,2,participant,Yeah.,4,1
9,3,interviewer,"Just kind of seeing how people understand movements, how they coach them, how they think about them a little bit like that. And so I picked the Kong vault, just as kind of a well known move to start with. But I guess the first thing to kind of check with you then is, are you familiar with the term Kong vault? Is that the term that you use?",265,69
9,4,participant,"Yes, it is Kong vault. And I'm from Norway. So I we use Kong vault here. But I am also, I also know that it is known as catpass, as well.",99,31
9,5,interviewer,"Do you happen to know, erm, do you think there's like, any differences between any of the names? Or is it all just as it's spread around, people use different names at different times?",143,34
9,6,participant,"Obviously, I have no idea because I'm, I'm not. It is kind of funny, because you say that you search after parkour coaches? Well, I'm not that experienced coach, nor that I am very experienced athlete. But I think it's just how they name it because, well, you see, in the UK or Norway, they're basically the same moves with different names. So that's basically it. For me at least.",291,70
9,7,interviewer,"And just kind of in your own words, how would you kind of describe the Kong vault? It is a very big question. But, just, you know.",98,27
9,8,participant,"Yeah. It is a way of overcoming an obstacle with your feet between your hands, I guess. There's, there's so there's so much thing to say about this and at the same I have so little little to say because it's it's basic move. It's just you just overcoming an obstacle that is waist high. But of course, in some cases, it can be lower on or it could be higher.",273,71
9,9,interviewer,"So is there, like, how would you kind of I know normally, you know, we'd demonstrate it for coaching, right? How would you kind of just describe that are there are there particular things about it that you go, that's what makes it a Kong vault?",189,46
9,10,participant,"Hmm. I guess the power or the height that you get from it, because compared to all the other, stairs, step vaults, speed vaults is like continuing movements, so your chest is on same level, with dash you kind of push yourself, with lazy, you go over to the side, while with kong, you basically kind of fly because you pop off with your hands and you get your chest up. And it's basically compared to fly feeling like you were supposed to launch yourself. And is, and you have also the height differences. So you can start very, very low and then pop yourself very high up and you need to take the impact afterwards.",482,116
9,11,interviewer,"Is it, how would you kind of break it down? Are there particular ways to take off for the movement?",77,20
9,12,participant,What do you mean by that?,19,6
9,13,interviewer,"So like, just kind of in general, because obviously I know that there's always going to be a bunch of different ways you can do movement, it's you know, it's pretty open but just yeah, I guess thinking about like the basics of it. Are there particular ways that people go into the movement or take off?",236,57
9,14,participant,"The basic is, firstly, to look at the object so they wall you're konging or the rail your konging, spot the difference then the distance between yourself and object so firstly, run up how far you're gonna get. So if you have konged, like hundred thousans of walls, you will be, it will be very easy to say like, if you're standing right here, five metres from the wall, you say this is too much power, you can immediately tell it if you come a little bit closer you can spot the optimal place so from there we can start.",405,100
9,15,interviewer,So is there like an optimal distance to be from an obstacle?,48,12
9,16,participant,"Yes, you need to spot that. You will learn it after some time after many many times and also somehow you've come as close as possible to the wall and just didn't then just count the steps back or such ago.",160,41
9,17,interviewer,I'm sorry could you just repeat that last sentence because the the internet broke up a little bit.,79,18
9,18,participant,"Yeah all right. So you just come as close to the wall as possible and then you count steps going backwards, so take huge steps like if you would just run normally you're just like let me take four steps and then you stop there and this is basically how you would run, you count your steps backwards, and from there you you know how your run up is gonna be so after after you have done your run up you can come a little bit closer to check the wall check the height check the check if you can see the object because sometimes you just can't see it because of the wall you could just go backwards and as you run you need your speed needs to be either increasing so you can slow down or it needs to be increasing and just continuing the speed, you can't slow down. With the last steps you needing to dip down so kinda, um, kind of the horse movement you know how horse gallops it imitates the that kind of movement but you don't, but it can't stop you can't slow down while you're doing it and after that you push push out come up with your chest upright you push out with your arms you straighten your elbows you push with your fingers and you bring your knees up to your chest and straighten out straighten out and then you land.",970,242
9,19,interviewer,So once you're kind of over the obstacle you you extend back out from that knees to chest position.,79,19
9,20,participant,"Yes, yes it is because you need to take out the impact and for you to do it you need to extend as much as possible your legs to be able to absorb that impact as much as possible because you if you're gonna have your knees bent then it will then the impact will be much harder to take.",222,60
9,21,interviewer,"So you kind of want to end up in almost like a, as if you'd just jumped over the obstacle?",68,20
9,22,participant,Yes.,3,1
9,23,interviewer,"And how about if you're trying to like run out of the movement rather than land from like a jump, is it any different or is it just [unclear]",109,29
9,24,participant,"It is different. It depends if you're trying to, because if they if there are two walls with the same height let's say hips height then what I have spotted is that there is a difference if you're just kong if you're if you're trying to kong to precision than kong to stride because if you try kong to stride, uh, what I've seen is that you land higher if you do if you do that so I think it is because of the knees. The harder you you take your knees up or so to the chest the more height you're going to get and with the kong it is important that you take a split step before you're taking it taking it so not just punch and going to kong but take a split step and it's basically the same with landing afterwards it is if there is only one wall that you're trying to go over and just flat surface then you will basically try to land first with your left or and then with your right and so on which which one do you take off from.",724,191
9,25,interviewer,To try and land on one foot to keep running?,34,10
9,26,participant,Yes.,3,1
9,27,interviewer,"Keep moving, mm. What about, I think you mentioned on the obstacle as well that something about the hands and the fingers?",97,22
9,28,participant,Mm.,2,1
9,29,interviewer,Are they they kind of pushing you off the wall or are they just kind of-,56,16
9,30,participant,"With the fingers you basically... what we as as a coach have tried to teach it to the to the other kids to get the motion so if you would stand up right now and go down to the squat and place your hands over your shoulders try to kong from there without straightening your knees, if you would just push as much as possible with your fingers. And this basically it. In, I have, I've written it down, because I have also researched Kongs. And I write a book about it, maybe I want to write a book about I don't know if it will be seen that much. So the Kong is one movement, it's not, it's not like you're going forward and upward, it is one movement, you go straight up. And this is how it it needs to be done, you can't just go first upward, so you can't jump and then place your hands on the obstacle, because then it looks like dive kong. The further you are away from the obstacle, the more it looks like a dive kong. So hypothetically, if you're very close to the wall, you're doing the kong vault best I would say. But you also need to remember that you can't hit your knees on the on the wall.",843,220
9,31,interviewer,"I like that diagram, just to kind of put it into words a little bit because I need to transcribe this. It kind of showed a vaulting box. And instead of having like two arrows indicating your motion over it, where you go up and then horizontal. It was just the kind of good example was just the diagonal arrow over the box. It's kind of like a single, single movement.",288,71
9,32,participant,Yes.,3,1
9,33,interviewer,"This might be a bit of a strange question, but does the angle of that arrow, that diagonal arrow change, or is there like a perfect angle you want?",115,29
9,34,participant,"Not really, it really depends because in some cases, when you don't have a wall and you have a rail, suddenly you're stripped down with the ability to use your hands. So you can use your hands that much. But the rail also have its advantages, so you can grab it. And in some cases when you kong up or the obstacle is is a little bit downwards, you can grab it and pull yourself and so there's this advantage that you don't really have with Kongs on normal walls because you can't grip and grip nothing. So you with I would say with Kongs on walls, you push yourself where in some cases with Kongs on rails, you pull yourself.",488,121
9,35,interviewer,"Does that make a difference to kind of other parts of the vault on you know, if you have like a wall or a rail, can you go further on one than the other? Or faster or anything?",135,38
9,36,participant,"I would say yeah, yes. You need to be more cautious when you kong on the rails just because you need to... Then there is another thing here just because you need to grab. Grab it really right. I don't know if you can see the hand.",175,47
9,37,interviewer,"Oh yeah. Like a, a perfect place on the hand.",33,10
9,38,participant,"Yes. So basically, if you have to hand you can't grip your walls huge with just with your finger because then it will fall you can grip obviously here. So you need to just right here.",143,36
9,39,interviewer,Perfect position between the thumb and the index finger.,47,9
9,40,participant,"Yes, so you can close, and it's really hard because a rail is very small and very thin. So you can it's very easy to just slip so you need to concentrate instead of concentrating so much on landing which you shouldn't concentrate too much on landing because you need to first it is also shown here. I have so much things with you.",259,64
9,41,interviewer,This is very impressive. Not many other people income with their own research.,64,13
9,42,participant,So this you can see numbers so this is right this is right when you think this is first you first think about run up then here you and the landing. But the things you can't do is first think about run up and then think about landing so you just completely ignore the obstacle here which obviously you can't do you need to think and focus on the things that are that are here. And we can take just almost stunning precision you need a running precision you need to firstly think about your steps because if you don't you're gonna fail fail or just...,435,106
9,43,interviewer,"Do you think that's like a common mistake people make, is to worry about the landing on the other side and forget to focus on their takeoff and things?",120,29
9,44,participant,I would say yes sometimes you can see even in some elite high class high class athletes as [name] I believe in there was one video when he was trying kong on the rail to the other the other rooftop and there's and there was a death drop and I knew that he knew that there was this danger that he would slip he he took time and in the end he did it but he had what he mentioned that he slipped actually so it was very close for him to fail so yes I would say it is something I struggled with when I when I tried not particularly kong but other things like standing precision not not saying not running precision so when you're when you're taking running precision with limited steps or with limited place to take to take off it is really important and it teaches you to count your steps and look at your steps first.,648,162
9,45,interviewer,"Does the, how can I put this, does the the kind of takeoff for the movement really dictate how the rest of its going to go?",95,26
9,46,participant,"Yes absolutely. I don't think you can do a kong diagonally, of course you can but you can't just run forward and then kong to the left or to the right so if you're facing a wall you need to figure out the best possible run up and you can't zigzag your way through so you can't just run like that sometimes you will need to curve it that is possible so when you see that or when you have a wall that you need to kong on and you realise that you don't have enough space so you start with like a banana shape run up this this  just dictates where you're going to go of course if you have that banana run up you won't be won't kong pretty straight you will go to the side but it's I would say that you still if you decide where you want to kong or in which degree you want to turn.",602,162
9,47,interviewer,"If, you mentioned having not enough run up for kong for example, is that because you need a certain amount of like speed to get a distance on the other side of the obstacle for something you're trying to land on? Like if you're doing a kong precision?",198,48
9,48,participant,Yes and the speed is important thing so unless there is not enough run up for you to generate the speed from so if you have if you have a wall you can push yourself out to generate more speed sometimes you don't need it because your dip technique is so good that you can generate power from nothing and this is very very nice thing to do very nice challenge do to look at the kong that you know that you can do and you have done it but just take it a step closer just to push yourself just to get that dip down technique even better.,423,109
9,49,interviewer,So I mean if I'm understanding you right you're kind of saying that you can get more power and you know distance in the movement by just you know having a good a good long run up and getting a lot of speed that way or you could get I guess stronger or better at the technique as well and generate similar power from less?,254,65
9,50,participant,"Yes because you need to be better at the technique but the thing with speed and with run up it's not only that you need to, you don't only need to have enough run up and then have speed you need to control it because this is the thing that is very very difficult even for me, to be able to control the run up and that and to manage that fear of not bashing your knees into the wall while you're full sprinting and gathering that that force that's the speed that you need to know that you need to have to cover the distance to the obstacle it is very difficult. But I think it also will be manageable after after many tries.",491,125
9,51,interviewer,"You mentioned a little bit about, you know, being scary if you're going particularly fast is it? Is the Kong kind of, can it be quite scary movement? You know, diving at a thing-",137,34
9,52,participant,"Yes, yes, of course it can be scary, especially if you don't have if you don't have built in the muscle memory that you need to bring your and bring your feet first, because Kong is very different from double Kong, in double Kong, you dive in with your head and your hands first, while with Kong, you take your hands, and you take your feet first. So you're not diving, you're just saying, you're not diving with your head, first, you're diving with your feet first. And in some cases, when there's a lot of speed, you can clip your feet and just go full scorpion, sometimes. Sometimes, you can just forget to, I guess it happens to for beginners that you just forget to bring your feet or just you don't have enough power to bring yourself up. So you clip your feet on the obstacle. Now that also happens.",623,152
9,53,interviewer,Is that a case of not being able to create like enough space for you knees and feet to come up?,74,21
9,54,participant,"Yes. And also, sometimes it can be mobility problems. So of course, if the if the person is a beginner, and he won't have that much, and he will, he will struggle to generate that force to push yourself out and to generate space between your chest and your obstacle and the obstacle. So of course, the more space between the obstacle and the chest, the easier it is to bring your feet. And at the same time, you don't need to bring your feet at the same time. So you don't need to just go forward you can take firstly one foot and then the other. And that's what I have seen in my videos of my Kongs that I don't take my feet at the same time just like a feet apart first down there. And then second, but in the end they're, I'm landing with them together with my feet, feet together.",604,155
9,55,interviewer,"Is that maybe because of the the staggered step take off, the gallup kind of take off. But you know one foot is going to be in front of the other. So maybe that one comes up first?",139,38
9,56,participant,Yes.,3,1
9,57,interviewer,Because it's it's literally nearer to your chest when you take off right.,58,13
9,58,participant,"Yes it's just easier. Yeah, that's the thing. And with the just punch technique is easier to just go up and bring your bring two feet together.",111,27
9,59,interviewer,"Do you find that, is it like a difficult move for people to learn? Or? Well, obviously some some people are going to show up and get it straight away. Some people are going to really struggle but just kind of in general?",172,43
9,60,participant,"I think it's a it is a mediocre move. For this vault, it is not as easy as step vaults, step vaults everyone can pretty much get it in no time after one training. So it's not a move I recommend learning if you have just started parkour. But it is a move, I think it's a mediocre move. It's kind of easy to get, hard to master. So easy to learn, hard to master, hard to master, I would say.",292,81
9,61,interviewer,"So you can you can kind of get the basics of it fairly, not easily, but fairly soon after starting but you can, you can kind of progress that to some really advanced stuff if you wanted to.",148,38
9,62,participant,"Because everyone can say yes, I can do a kong pretty much but not everyone can say yes, I can kong on the same two walls 10 feet apart. So.",106,30
9,63,interviewer,"Do you find, do you think it kind of lends itself to quite a lot of situations? Is it quite a useful movement in general?",94,25
9,64,participant,"I would I would say yes. It is useful. It's not very safe because I would say if I'm trying to run away from from someone, I would much rather use step vault and it is much quicker, much much safer. But if you if you need to launch yourself I think it is quite quite an interesting move to learn.",228,61
9,65,interviewer,Do you think it's like a natural move or do you think it's something that you know people have been invented for parkour a little bit?,106,26
9,66,participant,Hmm.,3,1
9,67,interviewer,"Or a bit of both, or something else entirely.",35,9
9,68,participant,"I think it is, erm... I think we look at, it is quite similar to monkey, a monkey so I would say so, I haven't seen monkeys move that much but I would say compared to the others it is much more natural I would say so compared to dash for example that looks completely ridiculous is unnatural I would say the way that we launch ourselves to a far wall it looks cool but I don't think I will have ever seen any other, any other animals given do that while, while kong I would say it is quite a, it is quite natural I would say.",405,108
9,69,interviewer,Natural but not necessarily like instinctive maybe? So like people have to learn to do it but it's quite a natural movement once they do.,110,25
9,70,participant,"Yes, yes and and also there are many many people that doesn't even need to learn that move, they just they just know it and because they it comes natural naturally-",130,31
9,71,interviewer,So people will- sorry go on.,21,6
9,72,participant,While while some other some others like lazy or step vault even step vault because it is quite confusing with the left arm and arms and feet just by looking at is quite difficult but just by looking you can fairly recreate the kong vault even without having knowledge on parkour on a basic move.,240,55
9,73,interviewer,"How um, how did you how did you find learning it, did you find it easy for yourself or was it difficult?",80,22
9,74,participant,"It wasn't really that difficult I have been learning parkour I had learned parkour by my coach which is [name], there was a parkour class that I attempted and there was this one training that I missed and it was on basic kongs but after after a week and after that training I just, ehm, I asked what did I miss and then the other coach said that I missed the basically how to do a kong vault and I was like no I like kong so much and he just said okay well do monkey plant on top of this obstacle and I said alright and I've just did it and he just said alright now do a kong and I just did a kong, it is it is completely natural to me but it was really hard really hard to master the dip-up technique I struggle a bit, I didn't understand how it's basically how force would push me back up, I just looked really really weird while trying to learn it it's just these four steps just a matter of these four steps but right now i'm feeling really confident and the thing is also very important that i don't see people doing you can see the quality of the kong just by someone doing a standing kong so if you if you have an obstacle and you just stand 30 or 40 centimetres from the obstacle placing your hands and just doing a standing kong from there you can because then in the air you need to go into that snake move that dip up technique, I have it on the I have it on the video-",1082,282
9,75,interviewer,"That's okay, because I'm not going to be able to transcribe that for my analysis but if you want to send it to me afterwards I'll be happy to look at it.",117,32
9,76,participant,"Yes, I can.",7,3
9,77,interviewer,"I mean you mentioned that kind of dip before and I forgot to ask you about it is that you know it seems to be an important part of the movement, what is it kind of adding to the kong vault?",147,41
9,78,participant,"Its adding height so you so you can as I said if you don't have that much run up you just need to get better at that dip, that dip up technique. So basically what you're doing your you can already start with, at lower, so you don't need to get high I have it's writing down here. So... right here. So if you start, yeah, if you start high with upright and just upright, you will go down after after Kong. But if you are like not upright, just a little bit downwards, you will generate the force to go up. So same with this here.",401,107
9,79,interviewer,"So it's kind of getting you to come down so that you're coming up at the obstacle in your take off so that you're kind of arc over the obstacle is going up rather than... So basically, you're going over the obstacle at the beginning of an arc, rather than at the end of an arc.",212,56
9,80,participant,"Yes. So if you see, like a seamless curve, for example, you firstly need to go down to generate force to go up and back again.",96,26
9,81,interviewer,Like a like a regular jump in that you kind of go down to jump up. Yeah.,54,17
9,82,participant,"Yes. Just like just like a spring, you just go down just to reach your hands before the obstacles and push with everything you have.",105,25
9,83,interviewer,"Yeah. I'm impressed that you have like notes. And you're, you know, thinking about this stuff.",72,16
9,84,participant,"Yes I, I actually, I became really interested about that, that research of yours because I kind of do research myself. And basically, what I tend to do is that I tried to write down every single Kong tip that I can ever think of. So everything really from how wide your arms needs to be. While Konging to how your place in your... How do you see, how the positioning of yourself should be in mid air, for example. So everything from basics to pretty advanced?",359,87
9,85,interviewer,"And is that stuff that you just kind of develop for yourself by thinking about the movement? Or is it come from your coach, for example, or your community?",123,29
9,86,participant,"No, I stopped after two, no after some time, I stopped training parkour with my coach because the class ended basically, it just wasn't an opportunity. And but I still wanted to train parkour. So I hung around with him. And I still do so from we basically became from coach to student from, to friends, just because of that, just because I wanted to train with him more and more. And after that was that I was just sick, I, I didn't have anything to do. It was winter, I couldn't do anything, basically it was Corona. And I just thought that alright, it will be cool to write every single thing, just to just to be a little bit easier to explain, because I know every single thing of this, I know it but it's, it can be hard to explain it, it can be hard to explain explain every single thing, because you know it already to a person that doesn't know it at all. So it is it is kinda it helps me to it helps me to gather every single thing that I ever think of. And at the same time, I've made Insta post for people that if someone else have a tip that I can think of, they can just DM me and that's why I also talking to you because I want to hear a little bit from you. I've asked for tips. And every single tip I've I've basically seen was was the dip down tip, I know is important, but I already have it. I want to have more more tips basically.",1034,272
9,87,interviewer,"Do you think it's kind of one of the things I've been asking people when I've been talking to this. Do you think you know, sharing that kind of stuff between coaches is, you know, is really useful because a lot of people that I've spoken to, you know, they're kind of coaching from their own experiences. And, you know, would it be a good idea to have something more general out there to say, Hey, this is a good way to coach the Kong. These are some good tips.",354,90
9,88,participant,"Yes, absolutely, I would say because this is basically what I want to do afterwards. I want to release it to the public for everyone to see it and it it I would say it also helps coaches because coaches might have experienced that themselves but sometimes students have different approaches to different things to different to different tricks and it would be the same with kong there are different parts there are different approaches to kong learning kong and that may that are that may be good every single one of them but it's not sure that they're actually some of some of those different people we have different possibilities to learn different moves I don't know how to, how to describe it, for me it will be very easy to learn a kong for you it will it could be very hard and one coach could say you just do a kong while the other coach might explain it a little bit better so I think it would help coaches to learn a better and different ways to learn a kong.",778,183
9,89,interviewer,Yeah I mean everyone's going to like say have their own individual student journeys.,69,14
9,90,participant,Yes and and different tips on the kongs as well so that's why I'm trying to gather as much as possible because you may have some common tips that I've never think of think of and I might have some others. Both might be really useful but they doesn't need to be useful for that specific group of peoples they could develop their own way to teach kong for example.,287,70
9,91,interviewer,Do you think you know that that is there is potentially a risk though with that kind of approach that it starts to become too formal that you know you might go well this is the way we teach the kong and actually kind of it starts locking it down too much? Or do people need to be able to experiment a bit?,241,63
9,92,participant,"Yes I don't think there is a specific way of learning... okay there is a specific way of learning everything for example when backflip and kong and everything but different people will have different approaches and whatever approach suits them if the end if the end goal is that they will learn it it doesn't really bother me so if the coaches have a different approach to learning a kong, if it in the end leads to learn kong vault it's I'm okay with that. There will be some ground rules that you need to apply so for example you need to push up with your arms and dip down and so on and so on but other than that you can explore experiment yourself as long as you see the progress.",543,132
9,93,interviewer,I like I like that I did like so so what are some of those kind of like things that that have to be there for it to be a kong vault? You know if there's all these different variations and things you do dive kongs and double kongs and all that stuff what's kind of what makes a kong kind of recognisable as a kong?,244,66
9,94,participant,"You can't go to the side so I've seen people that just kong and don't do it quite well so they, they bring their feet to the side over with your with one arm so they don't lean forward as much as possible this this is a thing everyone needs to be familiar with to have a pretty recognisable kong you can learn with punch punch technique you can learn with step two step technique both will be equally right but the other one will be not as efficient as the other one but I think yeah this is I would say this is basically it as long as you have your hands on obstacle you push out with your hands and you lean forward and then of course bring your feet afterwards as long as you do that it is pretty recognisable as kong.",571,145
9,95,interviewer,"And um, are there are there like particular things, I think you might have mentioned a little bit about this already. But are there particular things that you look for to say, that was a good Kong or that was a bad Kong? You know, particularly when you're coaching, are there things that you find that you have to help people with a lot, or?",267,65
9,96,participant,"Yes, I see. Sometimes kids use use their feet too much. So when they're trying to learn kong on the on the ground, it is important that you see if they're using their hands too much, or if they you're using their feet much are good Kong will rely on hands very much because you can, this is basically where where you can get their power, you can get their power from legs as well, it will help a lot if you have power, with legs, but their hands is equally as important. So you will, you will see clear difference between kids that, that rely on hands, and that rely on feet, that those that rely on feet just bounce like a frog and just they just tap the wall, just basically top of the with, with hands generating no power, while the other pushes themselves up. And this is what you're looking for. That they're that they can push themselves out, and not just tap the wall. Because it wouldn't work with higher wall. Of course, well, when we are teaching we're we're focusing on ground level and based on maybe 20-30 centimetres up on the bench on the bench. But the next step there is to try on the higher obstacle and then it won't work.",886,220
9,97,interviewer,"Is there is there like an obstacle that's too high for the Kong? Is there like a maximum height as well as... you could do it on the floor, almost but is it-",118,33
9,98,participant,Yes.,3,1
9,99,interviewer,Where does it kind of become too high?,30,8
9,100,participant,"I think it is up to each individual. Because I've seen people do Kongs that are extremely hard at like, our like head height, the same of their head, and then just and they Kong up I have no idea how they do it. I have I'm not familiar with that level. But I know it's possible. So I don't know, it is, I guess you need to check your boundaries. And if you know your boundaries, you can always break them.",308,82
9,101,interviewer,"I guess if if you can jump and kind of get your hands on top of the thing, there's always a chance.",75,22
9,102,participant,And pull yourself up [laugh],22,5
9,103,interviewer,"Is this um, does strength play a role in the kong? In that case.",48,14
9,104,participant,"Yes, I think strength plays a role, but technique is much more important. So without technique, you just wouldn't be able to, I would say technique is what makes it look smooth. And so it makes this is what the makes Kong look like bread and butter just like flowing like, like, like you can see a person without even touching it. You can see the person just flowing or flying, while with more power based with little technique. You will see the person go further. But it will be a little bit on I don't know, like seeing a beautiful scenario in 15 frames per second I would say. If you know what I mean? Yeah, a little bit hacky. You can see with power and without controlling technique, you will you won't be able to use 100% of your power. But with a good technique and with low strength you are using every single strength that you have. But you're using it 100% of your power. Even if you're probably is like 40% you're using 100% of that 40%. But if you have a power based Kong without technique, you're using 40% of that 100% power that you have. So you see the differences here.",841,207
9,105,interviewer,"Yeah, I see what you're saying. And so that kind of like flow is quite important to the movement? Like a consistent speed throughout?",105,24
9,106,participant,"Yes, it is. Speed is very important. I have another thing written in the book here. That said speed needs to be constant. So so you can see the speed like, like you're increasing and then the dip comes and-",159,40
9,107,interviewer,"Okay, yeah. So as as someone's coming in for their kind of two step gallop they they put the brakes on a little bit.",89,24
9,108,participant,"Yes. And this is thing that you it is not not real, not not optimal. This is also okay to do to just have speed increasing and then just holding the speed so so you can slow down, but you can surely increase speed as you go.",173,47
9,109,interviewer,"Yeah, so either keeping a consistent speed or accelerating right up to the point that you take off.",80,18
9,110,participant,"Yes, yes. And I was and I find accelerating easier to control for me at least. So if I'm going for higher Kong and or longer Kongs, it is easier to control them. And with the Kongs where, where you're trying to increase or maximise your run, you need to watch out your steps to them. So they don't sound like you're running with a 30 kilogramme backpack, on your on your shoulders, there needs to be gentle and you don't need it. You don't want to have that. That loud step I would say, it needs to be fairly silent, as well as the takeoff. You don't want to slap that you need to push yourself. Now of course with higher speed, and if you're trying to join high speed, there will be a sound because it was just it just happens so fast. But-",568,146
9,111,interviewer,Do you mean with the hands? The hands on the obstacle?,42,11
9,112,participant,"Yes. Yeah, it's with the hands on on the obstacle. If you're when you're trying to Kong it and the hands on are on the obstacle. I this this is only this is the thing that I have found. That is that the volume doesn't it doesn't need to be that much high. I mean, how would I describe it.",216,60
9,113,interviewer,"Is that also sorry to interrupt, but is that also just kind of a, to try and avoid injury, you know, you don't want to be like slapping-",103,28
9,114,participant,Yes.,3,1
9,115,interviewer,"-slamming into this obstacle too hard, you know.",38,8
9,116,participant,"And also, it means that your technique is not that good. Because as I said, if you just slap it, it means that you're using more power, and you're not using your whole fingers. While if you just slap a little bit in higher speeds, you will slap it, and you will hear sound but not that high sound that you will if if you don't have the, the technique.",269,70
9,117,interviewer,"Just to kind of describe that gesture you just made, is that kind of rolling from the base of the hand through to the fingers and then pushing off the fingers?",127,31
9,118,participant,"Yes. So basically, you're placing your whole hand and then just pushing out. I have also it's written down here. So you can just find it... I have many things down here. So this is actually a scene taken from the book. This this is the only thing that I haven't imagined myself, which is coming from the book. Max Barker's book, the wild thing in the wild world.",277,69
9,119,interviewer,I'm not familiar with that book.,25,6
9,120,participant,"Yeah, you can, but at the end of that book, it is it is auto biography. But at the end of that book, you will see some kong tips and one of them is to use your hand and I have basically just taken, taken it there, there are some other tips such as dip down of course, there is tip to use your arms. Tip three, try and try again. To have your to have your chest upright, as you see here. And extra tip four that says one undershoot one overshoot and the third will be a stick. Not always. But that's how. That's the sum of words. And I I have been left unsatisfied, with this because Kong is so much more than just those four tips. So this is only this is this also thing that pushed me to write that book.",538,146
9,121,interviewer,"Just because I'm curious why, why does that talk about having your chest upright? What does that benefit?",84,18
9,122,participant,"Because if you, if you do a Kong and you have your chest curved, you will go out face first, you will go out a little bit face forward, you need to have that upright to gain that momentum to have good posture while mid air. So you can spot everything so you can see. And also, if you have your chest a little bit downwards, you will slightly go down, you will go a little a little bit down. But in if if there's a battle of height that you tried to kong on the same walls that are very far away, you need to push up and get that power. And for for you, to need to be able to do that you need to straighten your chest and to have the chest upright.",497,136
9,123,interviewer,"So it's about kind of your body position when you come out of the movement, setting up-",68,17
9,124,participant,"Yes, body position in mid air is also very important. I've written the same here.",63,15
9,125,interviewer,"Okay, so it's kind of you know, where you're looking perhaps, or where your, or where your head is going is kind of where the rest of you is going? A little bit?",121,33
9,126,participant,"Yes, yes, yeah. Sometimes when you dive too much, so when you push a little bit more with your head. So it's a do a little bit of the the double Kong technique, you will curl your chest because the thing you do when you're curling is that you bring your need to bring your feet, it will be hard to be to bring your feet more up, because when you're in this position, it will be hard to squeeze your feet. While if you're in this position, it will be much easier to do that. And this is also the the thing the balance you have. So if you're battling with a Kong that is very far away and on the same height, you can check that. So if you if you do a kong and you have curled, and you should spot on the camera you have curled back, it means that you have very much too much power too much run up and too little push, push up. And if you have good push, you will see the chest but if you don't land on the wall, exactly, it will mean that you need to have a little bit more speed. So that lasts between speed. And then the push up as I said earlier it is it needs to be a continuing movement up not up and then just.",851,233
9,127,interviewer,I guess it's kind of similar to what you're saying about the takeoff in if you're if you push too hard with the hand and hands are slapping too much things like that. They're also kind of putting the brakes on a little bit. Right? You want that consistent movement over the obstacle.,223,53
9,128,participant,Yes.,3,1
9,129,interviewer,So it's kind of that chest up thing is kind of about making sure you're not over rotating when you're diving forward. And you know just landing on your head essentially.,134,31
9,130,participant,"Yes because this is a thing that I have. I'm too good at because I have struggles to do double Kong. I can't do other it, I haven't learned it yet. But I am very good at the simple Kongs. And since this is the fact that I have burned, written down or burned in my heart that I know every single muscle memory of that Kong so every time I tried to do a double Kong, I just immediately do I just bring my feet first because I've had it written down my muscle memory is so good. But it is good. It keeps me from injuring myself. So I sometimes I have felt sometimes that when I'm even in this position because something happens to me. I can manage to squeeze my abs even more and land with my feet. It is also very important and something that I find really useful. So when you're in that position that that you feel that you have curled your back, to squeeze extra your abs to bring your feet higher.",698,180
9,131,interviewer,"I'm curious as well, because you mentioned about one of the tips in that book being one where you overshoot where one more you undershoot or something like that. And then one where you get it perfect.",160,37
9,132,participant,"Yes, that was the was the Max Barker. Yeah, I haven't really, I haven't written it down in my book. But it was that you overshoot one Kong and you undershoot and you know that, you know, the forces that are applied, and when you're over shooting and shooting, so you can measure it.",216,54
9,133,interviewer,So it's a case of just kind of figuring out how much power you need to put in to land on the thing you want to land on.,90,28
9,134,participant,Yes.,3,1
9,135,interviewer,Okay.,4,1
9,136,participant,"It of course it does, it doesn't work when you have a death drop on the other side, then you need to slowly check and slowly if you're, if there's no way of overshooting, you need to undershoot let's just have a little bit more power, undershoot, but just a little bit more power, and eventually, you will stick it, you will find that balance.",265,65
9,137,interviewer,"And I guess as well just kind of doing lots of different Kongs to different distances and different obstacles over time you build up that experience to be able to judge the power in something brand new that maybe you haven't done before but you go ah, this looks similar to this other one. And so you don't really go through that.",264,62
9,138,participant,"Especially on different heights. And this is where we're just this thing comes to my mind that you can basically stand anywhere from a wall and you can check Alright, I can kong from here, okay, not from here, but all right from here. And this is also thing you can teach with your students or with your, this is the thing I have tried with my friend that you just place a person away from a wall, that is that you feel it just places somewhere from the wall, and they will try to kong it the way that you have tried. So you just you describe the way that this run up needs to be done. Just to bring different problems. And because it if you have similar problems that you need to curve around to get more speed or dip down a little bit more, or something else, it will be really useful.",616,156
9,139,interviewer,"To just kind of it's kind of the whole point of this study in a way is seeing that there's a lot of variations you can do for these things. But there's like a core part of it, that kind of stays the same, and then things change around. Is that what you think? Do you think that's fair to say?",222,61
9,140,participant,"Yes, because Kong is just a move. Kong is a move that there are set rules that needs to be done for it to be called Kong, good Kong. And the thing that changes its environment. And you can do on 100 Kongs or standard Kongs where the wall is like this, and you need to come on the on the edge. So, if you have for example, here, this this is seen from from, right, if it, for example, seeing from over and if this is you into Kong like this.",334,92
9,141,interviewer,"Right, so kind of going into a corner.",29,8
9,142,participant,"Yes. So instead of placing your both hands on one wall you're placing two hands on two different walls. Yeah. And, and you need to learn to kong like that, for example, you will have more space for your feet. So this will be a little bit different. But it's it's the same move. It's just a kong.",224,58
9,143,interviewer,"Yeah. Yeah, the same is the environment changes, but the move adapts and stays the same. Yeah.",73,17
9,144,participant,"It's yeah, the movement that adapts. It's the same with rails. You can't use your hands that much to push yourself out because you need to grab it. But then you can pull yourself a little a little bit better if this is a Kong or a wall that you need to land on that is lower, but a little bit apart. That you will have no problem just Kong on a regular wall. But it's a rail, you can kind of push yourself out. I mean pull yourself for that [unclear]",344,92
9,145,interviewer,"And you know, you've got things you've come up with, but you mentioned as well, you're looking for, you know, more tips and then other coaches, perspectives on the movement and stuff. Is there anything in particular that you'd like to know more about the kong vault or anything you feel like you don't understand yet you'd like to know more about?",272,62
9,146,participant,"Yes. It is, Konging on higher walls, then. So if this if this there is a wall that is this height, and the other wall or wall that you try to land on that is higher? I haven't experimented with. I haven't tried, I haven't tried it yet.",176,48
9,147,interviewer,"So actually, the hands for the Kong are on a wall, but then the wall you're trying to land on is higher than that wall?",91,25
9,148,participant,"Yes. So this is the thing I, I wonder, because then the first thing is this. It needs to be a little higher. So instead of that pointing thing to be just-",117,32
9,149,interviewer,So it changes your angle of that diagonal arrow we talked about earlier? Yeah.,63,14
9,150,participant,Yeah.,4,1
9,151,interviewer,And you think that that changes the movement?,37,8
9,152,participant,"I will say yes, a little bit because then it's not that distance based. It's more power based or up based. Because if you see long Kongs, it's more distance base. If you see if you take the double, double Kong, really a good double come from [name], this iconic double Kong in Denmark, I would say he had tremendous power and tremendous run up, he needed to take, he just full sprint and had this whole parking lot and even this wasn't enough. So he stepped through over the wall and then proceeded to sprint full power. So but it this is just distance of here it is a little bit higher. So the higher we go, the more it looks just like standing, standing jump with your hands. Hypothetically, hypothetically. Yeah.",557,133
9,153,interviewer,"So it becomes more like an up and down movement rather than that arc, that horizontal-",69,16
9,154,participant,"Yeah. But but it is just as we go a little bit higher. But if you are like, here, don't think that changes is that you need, you need to go higher. So you need to bring your knees higher, and you need to bounce higher, you don't need that much momentum, on that much run up because it's not that far. Its just height.",239,65
9,155,interviewer,"Yeah, so there's like, there's like a certain amount of height change that can kind of be okay, and not make too much difference. But then, beyond a certain point, it starts to affect how you do it.",152,38
9,156,participant,"Yeah, yes. And at the same time, if you have two walls that are really, really, really, really far. There is no way you could kong it.",100,27
9,157,interviewer,"So you're you're kind of you're you're kind of landing, whatever you're trying to exit the movement kind of does kind of affect the rest of it as well. It's not like you can just do a kong and then deal with wherever you land on, you kind of have to take that into consideration when you're setting yourself up to do them.",249,63
9,158,participant,"Yes, because if you should try to a kong that are far away, you need to straighten yourself out. But if you try to do a kong up, you need to bring your feet higher. So you you will need to go in a squat position. Sometimes if there's a very big height difference.",202,54
9,159,interviewer,"You mentioned [name]. And like what is it about guys like him, and people that do these really, really advanced Kongs or really really high level kong. Do you think, what is it do you think that they're doing that lets them do that? Is it just experience, is it, are they doing it different? Or is it just they're really they're just able to commit to it? I mean, you mentioned being able to really sprint really, really hard. And I think you mentioned earlier about you know, taking that ability to sprint and not slowing down. Are they just really good at like really going fast and really holding on to that?",477,114
9,160,participant,You're asking a question that I also want to ask.,38,10
9,161,interviewer,[laugh],5,1
9,162,participant,"But but yes, I would say I would say, being able to control full sprint run up, it helps a lot. Having having that instinct. So if you try to kong, having that instinct to build up muscle memory that you know that you will save yourself having to know, splat or crane to build to be able to safely do a Kong over and over again, is also really, really important. knowing the difference between overshoot and undershoot. So knowing how much force you will need to apply for a different kong, which comes from experience. So experienced technique. I don't know this, it could be some something some oomph, that they have, or something that they have that they also want to know. But I don't know. I, I don't know.",555,133
9,163,interviewer,"Cool. Um, so I've we've kind of gone through a lot of the questions I like to try and hit with people, which is great. Is there anything else that like popped into your head or you've thought of that you, that we didn't get a chance to go over or anything you you'd like to add? Before we finish.",225,60
9,164,participant,"Um, maybe the last thing I've written in books, right now, I don't have that many pages. I can go through some interesting things, things. So imagining yourself during the move, of course, it's very, very important. If there is a danger involved, you need to imagine yourself doing the move, which also helps a lot. Imagine yourself how you would do it, which also applies to the other tricks or flips as well. To be, to stay to be able to stay committed while you're running. So the other thing I've seen that people commit then when you stand when they start run up, and when they takeoff, they're just like oh no, it was a terrible mistake. If you come if you commit you need to stay committed the whole time. And you can just take take your mind but I think it is also important in not just kong but else in other other things. And it just there's a drawing here forces applied when they're grabbing a rail.",708,172
9,165,interviewer,"Yeah, so the pull on the rail rather than being pushed with the flat hand.",58,15
9,166,participant,"Yeah. And reps for Kongs. It is also very important to have written a little bit more here. So monkey plant on top, precision on top. My imagining of course. Doing a Kong beside the wall is also just to check if you have the height.",180,46
9,167,interviewer,"Okay, yeah.",8,2
9,168,participant,"Bounce back with, but then you need to have the right angle, you can't just come off from it you need to actually push yourself out. Same yeah, same Kong different spot without it can be similar or just the run up.",167,42
9,169,interviewer,So kind of giving people experiences that let them get used to the-,54,13
9,170,participant,Yes.,3,1
9,171,interviewer,-movement without actually doing it.,30,5
9,172,participant,"Because every single thing you do you can build up to with reps or and also, the thing I have forgot to mention here is split step. So if this if there is a wall that is fairly low to the ground, you can land with your one foot on the obstacle and with one foot on the ground.",214,59
9,173,interviewer,"Yeah, so just yeah, just giving people maybe less intimidating ways to practice it.",67,14
9,174,participant,Instead of just going for it and breaking yourself when you practice this different splatbacks or different Kong. Kong preps you also build a muscle memory to catch yourself if you even if you don't have planned it in the future and this is this is a thing I see my generation so I'm 17 versus the other people's the Imax generation of kids I would say people in my age that just try konging then I remember this one person that have break their heel because they overshot Imax this iconic kong at Imax we just the thing that happened that's obviously you don't want to undershoot so he over shooted and completely missed the wall landed on on the surface afterwards and I think this is this is really stupid of course you have some people like Max Barker that 14 have done it and this is the thing I want if this is the thing i'm struggling to understand because at some in some cases we would call those people monsters they're obviously obviously humans so there needs to be a way that said that they have done it.,817,192
9,175,interviewer,Is that you know just to just to be clear like monster in terms of like-,56,16
9,176,participant,Because it is really-,17,4
9,177,interviewer,Really good athletes like kind of monstrously good.,43,8
9,178,participant,"Yes, because it is incredible or impossible that they have achieved this thing at such a young age and to-",85,20
9,179,interviewer,So it's kind of like natural talent?,28,7
9,180,participant,"Sometimes yes yes I would say yes the talent is talent is a part of it but also Max have a trained parkour in key, he didn't just go there and they just tried it he had he knew how to prepare he knew how to have done kongs before he he was familiar with kongs it is yeah so so obviously preparation and talent, I don't know I know about about talent.",273,73
9,181,interviewer,"It's tricky because yeah obviously people... you can kind of say like, oh they're just very talented and it almost dismisses the hard work that obviously goes into these things.",141,30
9,182,participant,"Yes, yes, that that's why I don't want to use that oh they're just talented yeah and same with same with Max split precision first flip precision to rail, I don't know if this was done I don't, I don't think so, I don't know. I have no idea but in the long run it is better to hard work beats talent that's it so in the long run even if I don't commit if I were to stand before Imax right now I could judge if I was good enough to do it if I feel strong enough or if I don't, even even if I don't do it now or commit to it now tomorrow after month or after a year I'm only 17 I have so much more years to do it and this is the thing that those people don't see I will say they just sometimes it's because of their environment sometimes it is because of other coaches encouraging just yeah come on come on just do it you have the power and so on so it really depends.",661,184
9,183,interviewer,Yeah it's it's good that you can kind of stay aware of your own abilities and judge sensibly if you should try something or not.,101,25
9,184,participant,"Because the only person that can judge if you're able to do it or not is you yourself, and no one should tell you otherwise.",97,25
9,185,interviewer,"Yeah. Okay cool, yeah unless there's anything else you want to add I'm happy that we've gone through everything pretty much that I need to go through and I'll stop the recording unless there's anything you want to say.",172,39
9,186,participant,"I was, I was kind of curious how many people have you interested interviewed so far or how many people are-",85,21
9,187,interviewer,"Uhm, I can tell you a bit more about that stuff but I'll stop the recording first.",63,17
10,1,participant,"But also, do you want like, is this for reference? Like, is this something where you're going to be coming back and going, Okay, this person said this? Or what? What's sort of like the use of these videos?",156,39
10,2,interviewer,"So they get transcribed into text, and then I analyse the text for kind of themes, essentially. So what people say across the whole thing, what I can kind of draw out of the collective interviews, right? And then also, yeah, highlighting individual things that people say that I think are particularly interesting or make a point particularly well, okay, no. Yeah. And I don't think... you didn't request any anonymity on the form, but if you want your name left out or anything like that, then I can just say, yeah. Yeah, it's it's, essentially, it's just looking, so that the study is to look at how kind of parkour coaches in particular in this case, understand parkour movement, considering that it's kind of a decentralised sport, right? There's, it's kind of grown up quite organically, there's not like a central source of movement... truth for want of a better word like, yeah, it's and it's, it's also spread kind of, quite organically. It's not like one person is like, unless I'm like, MovNat where it's like one person has come up with this thing. And these are the movements in it, people come, have come along and added and subtracted, and improved and refined. So just kind of talking to people about some of that stuff, and seeing how parkour coaches think about the movement, and pass it on and coach it themselves as well. And I just picked the Kong vault as a fairly well known movement, kind of one that hasn't seemed to be widely looked at, in other studies, a huge amount, as well, yeah. And just as a way of kind of filling in the information for me as a researcher, before, I might start looking at it in any kind of lab environment, to make sure that anything I look at is actually reflective of how it's kind of viewed in the community. So the place I've been kind of starting with people really is just to check. You know, is the term Kong vault one that's familiar with you? Or do you do you know it as something else? Like, what's, what's your preferred term?",1541,363
10,3,participant,"That's actually, yeah, good question. I have always used the Kong vault, I've always said kong or the word Kong. However, I am starting to move away from saying that, I'm trying to actually say catpass more. And I think, because I hear, the wider community reference, a catpass, rather than a Kong. And I think you know, more people recognise catpass than kong. I'm also starting, to realise like catpass sounds more of like a description, whereas a Kong sort of sounds like a brand. Sort of like Kong tm. It's sort of like, so",407,96
10,4,interviewer,Like vacuum versus Hoover. That kind of thing.,37,8
10,5,participant,"Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So it's sort of like, so maybe it's a subconscious thing. But yeah no, I've always said Kong, but I'm trying to say catpass.",107,27
10,6,interviewer,"Do you happen to know if that's the term you learnt the move with, you know, is that something you picked up? Or where you, where you first heard the term kong vault?",128,33
10,7,participant,"Oh, yeah. I was always taught that this was a Kong vault. And I see, to be honest, it wasn't even called Kong or catpass. And, you know, when Steph created it, when Steph started with it, I have a feeling that when [name] started when he took it from Stephane, because they had a very close relationship. That's, yeah, a slight guess. But I think I would probably be about 70-80% sure, that's where it came from. And I obviously learned from [name].",339,85
10,8,interviewer,So I guess kind of a good place to start then is just in your own words to help just how would you kind of think about describing the movement itself?,119,31
10,9,participant,"It depends who I'm talking to. So if I'm talking to someone like you, who wants like the technical term and understands biomechanics and shit, I would say that it's a hand first bilateral vault over over an obstacle. Yeah. So it's essentially your your, your arms are going first. And it would be very difficult. I can't quite think. I mean, there are there are other vaults, but not bilateral and not hands first. I mean, you've got like a front flip over the over the top. But so there are sort of like variations. But yeah, this really hands first bilateral movement. If I'm talking to other people, like beginners, and whatnot... It's kind of difficult to kind of explain in words, and this is why it's not very wise to just explain in words, you want to demonstrate it and sort of present it as well, so they can see it. But generally, it's sort of like trying to move over the wall in a straight line. Without any twisting. And yeah, like upper body first. And trying to get it to the point where it's not slowing you down. So that there's there's no no real, slowing down of the momentum, you're, you're actually able to increase momentum, and speed from using the vaults. So you're actually using the obstacle as sort of like a turbo boost as it was to kind of like get more power and more distance and whatnot. Yeah, that's how I describe it.",1043,252
10,10,interviewer,"And so a lot of these questions are obviously going to be very broad. And there's always going to be edge cases and individual bits, but just kind of what, what generally kind of obstacles might be used on or what uses might have, I guess.",188,46
10,11,participant,"Yep. So common obstacles would be like, mid quad, to sort of like, just above bellybutton height. Walls, or, like, rails, or fences are things roughly about that height. Because of the nature of having to have your upper body lead. It's, it's gonna be very, very difficult to get your hands and upper body above that obstacle, because you've actually got get your hips above that obstacle, if it's any higher than that. So you know, you can imagine something that's at shoulder height, trying to get your hips up behind you that's higher than that wall. Yeah, it's going to be very difficult. So it's sort of like going to be a bit lower. Things again, can be very low. It especially if you're going downwards, but just like, generally, that's not really done because there are better ways like jumping on it, you know, because anything lower than quad height is, yeah, you can jump over it or yeah, yeah, whatnot. So and also sort of generating momentum and force downwards. Yeah, it's not quite as as good, having your hands first. And also, if you're leaning downwards and you're going downwards, you'll start to realise that the having hands and arms going first also means your head is going first, and you'll start to realise that unless you have very, very, very good technique, and you're very comfortable going headfirst, your arms are actually going to slow you down, they're going to stop the momentum, rather than speed you up to carry on going further if you're going downwards.",1163,263
10,12,interviewer,"So you mentioned the hips coming up. I mean, so in your, in your description of the vault, you know, you mentioned the upper body going first quite a bit, it what's happening with the, with the lower body?",158,39
10,13,participant,"So essentially, you're trying to get, as I said, it's a bilateral movement, so both sides are doing the exact same thing, and your legs are gonna have to drive through between your hands. So as you're coming past the wall, both knees are gonna be coming up, and to get them up, or the whole leg up, you're, you're gonna have to jump, okay. And generally, the best way of trying to get that height is to get your hips up high. So as you as you're going forwards, you're jumping, to get the hips up, the higher, the better, to be quite honest. Even if you're going downwards, your hips are going to be high. And yeah, it anything sort of where you're sort of parallel, if you can get to parallel, then that's even going to that that'll be optimal jumping with your body behind you. And then then the difficult part is sort of timing, the legs coming through, as the hands are coming off, which is always the scary bit, because you're, as you're passing over the wall, you've done the jump, again, with your head forward. A little bit scary. But yeah, essentially, now the legs are coming through, as you're coming through that sort of like takeoff to mid, and then from sort of like midpoint of the vault to the landing of the vault. This is where things change. So it's sort of like, okay, hand, the first half is sort of like hands first, legs second, moving towards sort of trying to get as close to parallel as you can. And then as you sort of going past the midway point, you're then trying to drive the legs through. So actually, the legs are leading rather than the hands, unless you want to do that, unless that that is an alternative unless you want to go into like a dive roll, or something like that. But again, generally, you want the legs coming first, which means they have to be travelling faster, and you've got to be able to have the control of changing body position mid-flight.",1459,357
10,14,interviewer,"Is it- Is it the upper body on the obstacle that's kind of helping you get, changee that position in the air?",84,22
10,15,participant,"Yes, so it's gonna be... it's your kind of like pre-loading the position from the jump. So as you push from the beginning, you're actually trying to get into the, into a position where actually the rotation of your body, so as you pull on the wall, you're actually bringing and driving the knees through first anyway. So it will be a combination of the jump behind you and the wall that's going to be positioning you for whatever landing you're trying to take. But you're, you're not going to be changing position, mid flight.",409,96
10,16,interviewer,"So with the, with the kind of takeoff and landings, are they, are there particular ways of taking off and landing in the movement? Or perhaps perhaps takeoff first? Are there particular ways of taking off for the movement?",178,39
10,17,participant,"I mean, again, you can, there's a scale, right? So there's like the most common down to, you know, very, very obscure, and, you know, starting with the most common, the very basic ones are two foot takeoff. And you start with trying to understand trajectory, and sort of the arcs that you're you're taking. But yeah, the takeoff can be two foot and then it one foot and then staggered, actually and they're two different things. One foot takeoff and a staggered takeoff are different and obviously different different sides. Yeah, there's going at angles and all that kind of thing. And it can become more and more weird. Running into it with more momentum, again changes the body position, and the trajectory. So yeah, all the all these things are different variables and can compound up into being very, very complex.",643,143
10,18,interviewer,"Do they- Do they make a difference to the kind of midpoint of the movement on the obstacle? Or is it like the takeoff... It's kind of situational dependent. But once you're in the air, you know, you kind of approach the obstacles the same way, or do they, do they have an impact?",213,54
10,19,participant,"They, they have an impact, they're different. You know, if you're, if you're taking a catpass from a standing position, and there's no run up, no nothing and you're doing a two foot standing catpass, your trajectory is going to be completely different. Like there's no way you can generate the same trajectory as a running one. Because the, you can't get the angle, right. So pretty much, you're going to go much higher, and come down the other side, that the arc of the trajectory will be much higher, which means your body position will be different because as you're trying to preempt the landing, you're going to have to do it much, much quicker and higher. Whereas one where you're running in, so you, for instance, in the standing position, you can't go high and then travel far, right, which is what the running one could do, like the running one, again, it would be very difficult to do the opposite. You can't run in and then just drop right behind the obstacle, because your trajectory is changing. And yeah, you wouldn't be able to do that very, very easily. And I dare say, somebody would probably be able to do it. But yeah, it's very hard to do that.",899,212
10,20,interviewer,"And what about so like, landings or the other side of the obstacle? Is there a similar kind of variation?",83,20
10,21,participant,"Yeah, so again, a lot of this stuff is environment dependent, right. So it really, really depends on, yeah, the the environment dictating what you do, and how you land and how you take off. So which, which is why Parkour is so great, right? Because you can do it for the whole of your life. And you can always do a different catpass, because you'll always have a different situation. That landing, again, depending on the person, so if you're starting off with somebody new, you want to eliminate any complexity, you want them just to get like the most simplest of landings, and that would be a stop. So you're just trying to get them to focus on the harder part, which would be the takeoff and the midpoint, but then they just land. And then you're sort of starting to work towards being able to continue, keep the momentum going from the 'in' part, and then sort of like trying to refine that so the amount of momentum and power that's coming in, is the amount that's coming out, you can keep going. And then potentially, you know of some people, you can actually generate more power, because as I said, you can use the obstacle to help you generate more power by pulling on it.",919,219
10,22,interviewer,"It's, um. So you mentioned the pull there is that... So that's on the obstacle, with the hands kind of generating force like you say, is that like a technique thing or a strength thing? Is that something that is important to the movement?",184,44
10,23,participant,"It is important, but again, it's dependent on the environment. So again, it depends what direction you're taking, and where you want to go. So if, for instance, you're on something high, and you're going downwards towards a landing, so that the wall is a bit lower than you and you're going toward the floor, then the pull would be very, very easy, because you're basically got gravity behind you and your hips are already above it. The only thing is you need to keep tucking, the hands are not going to be pushing you to go up high. Right? So you're not going to be slapping the wall to get height, you've already got the height, whereas the opposite, whereas if you're going upwards to something higher, you need to get height because you're already below the wall. So again, in that situation, you probably want to push up high to get that height so you can drive your legs through and get into a higher landing position.",721,169
10,24,interviewer,"So one thing I'm really curious about with all this is, you know, mentioning a lot of variations and takeoff and landing and the obstacle itself. And this might be a bit of an abstract question, but kind of what what is the thing that then makes it a recognisable Kong vault? You know, if there's all these different variations, but yet we can, you know, we know from experience, we can look at someone and go, yeah, they just, they just konged over that obstacle. ",363,86
10,25,participant,Yeah.,4,1
10,26,interviewer,"What, what's, you know, what might be kind of the thing that you put your finger on and go, that's why I've called that a Kong vault?",99,27
10,27,participant,"Yeah, so it's kind of like it's kind of like calling a car, a car. Right? There are millions of different models, there are different many, many different colours and shapes and sizes, and, but they're all cars, right? And you can recognise a car regardless of the shape, and the colour and the size and everything. You know, a car is a car. And a motorbike is a motorbike. Because the way it functions and the way it behaves is different to the car. So with the Kong vault, yeah, there are very, there are many, many variations and people are always coming up with many variations, or different variations. But in essence, it just sort of boils back down to that very basic hands leading bilateral movement. Beyond that, you know, the there are edge cases where, you know, you might not really think is it a car? Is it a motorbike, you know, three a Three Wheeler, a motorbike, a tricycle? I don't know, there's always gonna be those little kind of edge cases. So for instance, actually, it's specifically there is [name]. I don't know if you know him. And yeah, so he, he does like, like, a lot of discussion about a hurdle, he does like a hurdle, kind of kong, catpass, where he is able to crunch up so far, that his sort of like feet and hands are over the wall at the same time, so it's sort of the people don't know whether he's doing a jump, or a catpass. And it's really on that edge of sort of like, well, was it one or the other? At the end of the day? Does it really matter? It you know, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. It's just movement, and people are always going to do differently. But in essence, you know, it's sort of like widely understood that. Yeah, it's just a bilateral movement. Hands go first, knees come through. That's pretty much it.",1349,336
10,28,interviewer,"It's interesting, you say about maybe getting too specific about is this a Kong or not, doesn't matter. Do you think it's like an important parkour movement for people to try and learn or...",148,34
10,29,participant,"Not to begin with, no. At the end of the day, it comes down to the goal of the person, right, and importance is really down to the person. So you know, what one person may think is important, you get an old age pensioner, they don't give a crap about a Kong vault, right? They just want to maybe feel good moving again. Whereas, you know, you know, a young practitioner who's really fit and healthy and wants to be able to do everything. Maybe that's the only thing that they want to be able to do. And in fact, that that is a large case a lot of the time, you know, you've got people that go to spots, and all they ever want to do is the kind of cliched Kong cat or kong pre and the big ass jump and that's it. Because that's what is important to them. So, yeah, parkour... it's sort of, it's wise to separate the fact that parkour is not one definition. It's the person's definition of what Parkour is. And there is no guide, there is no like, this is what Parkour is. Because very, very frequently, it goes beyond those boundaries.",786,202
10,30,interviewer,"I guess, important might have been a poor choice of words, for me, but I guess I meant, I mean, I agree for one thing, but yeah. Is it perhaps a useful movement to try and learn? And then whether someone you know, particularly likes it or not, is, is a different thing? Or, or Yeah, you know, feels a pull towards it, or whatever. But is it just a useful, a useful movement in general?",291,76
10,31,participant,"Well, okay, so in the case of practicality, yes, that can be, it-... Yes, I would say it's not important, but it is very practical. And for the reasons of, when done correctly, there's very rarely you are able to do a vault, potentially a speed vault, or speed step might be able to do it. But there is no vault, where you can remain basically shoulder width, and do get across a an obstacle at speed and maintain that speed. So from a practicality stance, yes. It was very very handy.",369,92
10,32,interviewer,"Sorry to jump in, just because I can't transcribe gestures. Do you mean kind of, like, staying front on, you know, not twisting in any way or...?",108,27
10,33,participant,"Yeah, so you know, as I mentioned, the environment dictates what we can and can't, can't do. So sometimes, you might want to be able to get over an obstacle, but there are two posts between, er, to your left and your right. So you have to be able to, you know, get through that, while avoiding the posts. Now, the problem is, if you're doing a unilateral or a contralateral movement, you're you're basically going to be twisting, which is going to increase your physical width, and therefore making it very hard to keep momentum and speed. By doing a bilateral movement, like the catpass, you can maintain a thin profile between those posts, and basically keep momentum and speed. So yeah, it sounds like quite a niche, sort of situation, but it really isn't like it can happen, you know, because, again, takeoffs and landings and things like that are gonna dictate what you do, and they come up quite a lot.",706,164
10,34,interviewer,"In terms of like, fitting into a route, is it particularly useful there as well? Is that I may have said... [unclear] I dunno. Is it-, so, that kind of description, very thorough description",144,34
10,35,participant,[laugh] Sorry [unclear],17,3
10,36,interviewer," No no, its great, it's what I want. Is it, is that something you've kind of developed for yourself over time? Or is it something you remember being taught? or a combination of both?",139,34
10,37,participant,"Um, a bit of both. So, when, if we're talking specifically about me, I, it took me a long time to get it right. And I, from a coach perspective, seeing other students, it's one of those ones that does take a long time. Now, I can usually pinpoint the reasons for this. But there are sometimes some edge cases where sort of just the biomechanics of the person... you just can't work out why they're doing what they're doing. But generally, this is both for me and a lot of other students, the problem is twofold. Number one is trusting your arms to take your bodyweight while your hips are above the wall. So you're essentially in sort of like mid kicking up of a handstand position. Where you're sort of like leaning over on your hands, your shoulders are level with your hands. But now you're, you're kind of jumping up behind you. And a lot of people are worried because if they go a little bit too far, they're gonna feel like their head, they're going to go head first. And its, obviously it's very understandable, it's like something that we don't do very often, unless you're doing like a handstands and things. So kind of getting used to that is difficult. And that was always, you know, that was for me, as well. And the second thing is, and this is the one that I would say, catches most people, even those people that are able to do cat passes, is mobility, and just not having the mobility to get their knees to their chest, while keeping their hips high, and in that position with your head first. And basically, driving the legs through can be really hard. And just for clarity, I'm not talking about flexibility. So a lot of people can get into the flexible, can get into the position, but the mobility being that flexible position with your knees up to your chest, but with control and power. So, you know, you're you're able to get, you might be able to get your knee up sort of like, I don't know, belly button height, but can you actually get your knee up further than that? Without anything else helping it? It's sort of like, yeah, that being the difference.",1608,386
10,38,interviewer,"So is it, erm, do you find that people find it quite a scary move to learn? In general?",65,19
10,39,participant,"Yeah, like, definitely more because of the first one than the second one. And also, because I think a lot of coaches, I'm not trying to pick on other coaches, but I just, I see it 90% of the time, they don't know how to break it down properly. So, you know, they don't, they can't think of a way of getting students used to those positions and starting to increase their mobility and the fear of leaning forwards. Yeah, it's quite tricky to get people into that position, and then feeling comfortable. So yes, it can be a hard thing to learn.",416,103
10,40,interviewer,"Are there, erm. I mean, you mentioned some of the like, breaking it down and stuff, are the common ways you try and do that, or common coaching cues you give that you've found has helped people?",150,37
10,41,participant,"Yep, there's definitely so that, there's... actually, this is something that I guess I'm quite proud of, is the fact that I have spent a long time you know, critical thinking, trying to figure out how to do this for the maximum number of people. And the prime problem that I see is the granularity of steps of changes between, like the most basic to going up are always too big. So you know, you can get someone because students become excited that they've managed to do something, they automatically want to go to the next step. But that next step is always a bit too big. And, you know, some of them get it, some of them don't, but generally, sort of a lot of other like, technicality goes out the window and they kind of suffer because they have to push way harder if they have to put momentum in or something like that. And yeah, that there's just too much of a change. What I tend to do is rein that back. So make, I always try and go okay, if this was version one and version two is up there is there like two little mini steps I can put in between that generally because quality of technique is the first thing that always goes out the window. And yeah, I much prefer people to do it at high quality rather than introducing more variables like speed and height and distance and all that stuff. So yeah, but ,do you want me to explain how I teach it?",1055,262
10,42,interviewer,"Yeah, anything you're happy to share is good.",35,8
10,43,participant,"Okay, so like I said, the first thing is generally getting the hips high. And making the person realise whether they have good or bad mobility, right. So I always either I don't care how fit they are, or you know how able they are, what, and I even do this for warmups, I will always try to get them to start with a standing position, and both hands on the wall and jump behind them. So they're just trying to get their hips up high behind them. And that's it. When they do that, they're starting to, you know, get the feeling for that slight handstand position. And it's also showing them actually how high they're going to get their hips. Because if they can't get their hips high enough to then get their feet in, it's just not going to happen. So just practising that jump getting high would be step one, step two, would be marking how high their feet get up the wall. So as they jump and get their bum high, where on the wall, maybe brick, using bricks, as you know, visual kind of markers or something, you can see how close they're getting to the top edge. Third step would then be getting one foot on to that wall. So if they can jump up and get one foot on the wall, and then coming back down, that would be the next one. Fourth step, other foot, fifth step, would be then trying to get both feet on. Also, like getting one foot on, and then the other foot higher and higher and higher. So as they're jumping, they're kind of reducing the gap, sixth step both feet on. And at that point, I then try to explain to them that they don't want to keep the hands on the wall. So as their feet come on, they want to create space underneath them, and therefore taking their hands off. If they can't, if, again, that's a little bit of a tricky thing to kind of get in your head. So I will get them to do that on the floor. So sort of, I'll try to get them to do catpasses on the ground. Because on the ground, it's very hard to kind of have your hands flat on the ground and your feet under you at the same time. There's not a lot of space, but essentially, that's what you're going to be doing on the wall. So I try to kind of get that feeling of, okay, as your feet come in your hands come off practice on the floor, when they can do that-",1713,445
10,44,interviewer,"Sorry to interrupt, are the hands actively pushing them away from the floor in that case, or is it just, is it still in the jump?",100,26
10,45,participant,"Kind of like a reflex sort of like it's sort of like, as because they don't have usually the mobility, it's as the legs come in the torso is pushed up anyway, from the hip. And therefore it's very difficult to kind of keep the hands on the ground unless you have very good mobility anyway. So then their hands on naturally come up. So there won't be a push, really. But that can come later.",301,76
10,46,interviewer,"Okay. I have one more quick question. Sorry, that just popped into my head. So when you when you said about getting up with one foot than the other? Is that, um. What's the reason for just doing one foot at a time first? Is it less scary? Or is it easier mobility wise to build up?",214,57
10,47,participant,"Yep, again, it's sort of trying to give them something as like, it's easier to get one foot up and two. So again, it's a halfway step between two feet and no feet, right? It means that their hips have to get a little bit higher. They're still practising getting those hips up high behind them. And yeah, they can usually twist a bit on to their dominant side just to make that room to get that foot on. But obviously that then becomes a bit more difficult on the off off side and the other leg. But yeah, it's like mid smaller steps between nothing and both. Okay. Where did I get to-... so two feet on the wall. Once they once they can get two feet on the wall. Then I generally put like marks on the top of the wall. So I'm going to start to move them further along the wall. Or sometimes it's good for like a bench or something where there's something very wide to land on, they can practice getting distance without having to worry about a landing position. Yeah, they just stand, they're just staying in sort of like the mid position. And then when they've comfortable getting, you know, distance, you know, a foot or more, they go over it. And then we start focusing on landing and sort of body position. And again, when you start with something big, and then you start kind of reducing that landing position and start making alternatives, I'm, I'm less worried about the landing position, and more more focused on the body position. As long as they're not like leaning backwards when they land. That's really the bit that I focus on trying to make sure that they're landing forwards rather than back and not with their hands behind them, hands in front of them.",1299,311
10,48,interviewer,Why is that? Why is that for the body position?,36,10
10,49,participant,"Because, again, if your body is behind you, your momentum is going backwards. And the idea of the catpass is to keep going forwards. And generally, you want to be leaning forwards, because if you're not, you're not going to be able to have a controlled landing, or keep the momentum going. Okay. And also, it's classified as a different vault.",267,61
10,50,interviewer,"Right. Okay, and is it... do you find that some people can just rock up and get it straight away?",72,20
10,51,participant,Yep. All the time.,13,4
10,52,interviewer,"Is that like a conf- confidence thing? Or is it, is it just purely individual? Just some people seem fine with it?",88,22
10,53,participant,"Um, I think there were a lot of factors. Usually, people who are naturally, well not naturally but have, you know, more experience in sports, they're happy with their kind of, being able to kind of move their mobility is a bit better. And then, yeah, sometimes they just get it. So for instance, I, you know, I've had a couple of PTs recently, one of which was a guy who is actually on a TV show, quite a famous TV show. He's an actor, and he has done a lot of sports, because the production team have kind of told him, he's got to go and do these different things. So he's that, you know, he's done a wide variety of things like martial arts, and horse riding, and all this kind of stuff. So when I started teaching him parkour, he got it like, instantly, like, literally, session one, he'd never been parkour before, he was doing catpass to step to another catpass to a slide monkey on session one. So yeah, it was just like, some people just like pick up body movement, because they just feel that's naturally the way that they want to be able to move. And confidence. Yeah, that comes into it. By like, the structure, so sort of like lever lengths and things like that also come into it. So some people just naturally feel like, Oh, you know, I can, I can get through this much, much easier because their arm length maybe is a little bit longer. So they don't have to have as much mobility to get their legs through. Whereas some people might have like, tiny little arms and torso, but a long legs, you know, it all depends.",1172,291
10,54,interviewer,"Do you find that people come along to classes and whatnot, and and know what it is and want to learn it? Is it like a recognisable thing outside of parkour that people go, ah, yeah, I want to learn that, or do you find people have never heard of it before?",198,52
10,55,participant,"Not, I think they recognise the shape, they recognise the movement a lot. But sort of a large proportion of people when they come to classes and things they, they they don't necessarily know the name, but yes, they recognise the movement.",189,42
10,56,interviewer,"Is it, would you consider it like a kind of identifiably parkour movement? Is it done in anything else?",82,19
10,57,participant,"Yeah, it's done in other things. It's done in gymnastics, for instance. And in fact, yeah, it's a it's a recognised vault on the pommel horse. But yeah, I guess from this is going down the route of social media, and youtube and the internet and whatnot. People see a lot more parkour videos and parkour in the mainstream than they do gymnastics. So, like, I guess popularised it. Yeah, the catpass is quite an iconic parkour move that a lot of more advanced practitioners put into their movements. So it's highlighted a lot more.",413,95
10,58,interviewer,"Yeah, I always think when, when you see parkour in like film and TV and stuff, that seems to be the thing they go for to be like, yeah, this guy knows parkour.",121,33
10,59,participant,"Yeah, yeah, definitely. I think it's because it's sort of like a big, much bigger, powerful move. It's something like if you if you're gonna pick one vault, that looks the most impressive. That's gonna be it, right? Because it's the one that can generate the most power you can get the most distance is very versatile. everybody kind of knows what it is. It's sort of like, yeah, fits in, like, ticks all the boxes, basically.",325,77
10,60,interviewer,"I think as well, you said earlier, like, it's not something that people kind of, maybe naturally do in a lot of other walks of life. So when you see someone do it, it's you can go ah they've, it's not like someone doing a jump where you or I might be able to look at it and go ah that looked like a parkour jump, for most people it would just be a jump.",266,75
10,61,participant,"Yeah. Yeah, it's definitely, definitely more than iconic parkour move that, yeah. I think it's just more from the internet, right? It's literally, you know, from popularity of obviously, the more high ability people are the ones that have their videos watched, right, so everybody watches those. And because the catpass is the one that is close to like the top end of vaults, it's sort of like, it can be very, very advanced in very difficult situations. That's the one that the advanced practitioners are going to use. And because everyone is watching their videos, it's like, Okay, well, it ain't gonna be step vaults, and it's gonna be Oh, my God, check out that guy's step vault, is like, well, I say that, but a lot of people are doing like speed steps nowadays. They look pretty damn cool, too. But yeah, Kong, Kong is usually the one catpass.",655,151
10,62,interviewer,"Do you think maybe it gets up towards that kind of advanced thing because of the utility of it, or the aesthetic of it? Or...",96,25
10,63,participant,"I think it's more the utility of it. Not, not the aesthetics. Yeah. Because... Yeah, no, I mean, it doesn't look that amazing. Like, if you broke it down, if you did, like a really, really basic one. Over a wall. Yeah, one side to the other, boom. It doesn't look like that great at all you know, but... I don't know, I don't know. Yeah. I really do think it's more utility and practicality than than aesthetics. Especially since yeah, that there are a lot of situations where yeah, you just can't do another move. Because can't there aren't any other movements that lend themselves to that specific scenario. Especially, you know, catpass, er, sorry, catpass to cat leaps are the ones that sort of like a lot of people see on videos, and I don't, I can't really think of another movement, where maybe a dash vault, potentially, but yeah, it's very tricky to do any other different move.",671,161
10,64,interviewer,"Is it-... I'm curious sometimes, like, you know, a lot. A lot of the time you hear parkour described as like efficient movement as being stuff. Obviously, usually the most efficient thing would be to like jump on top of the wall and then jump off or something like that. So is it is there something about the Kong vault that I think you mentioned earlier about, you know, generating force that gives it gives it something beyond what might technically be the most efficient thing? Or is it just people like doing them?",409,94
10,65,participant,"Sorry, I'm gonna sidesteps very slightly about the efficiency thing. I had a really good definition of the difference between parkour and, parkour and freerunning and it was basically that parkour people take the most efficient route the most inefficiently, and freerunners take the most inefficient no sorry, the other way around. So parkour people take the most inefficient route efficiently, and freerunners take the most inefficient, no efficient route, inefficiently.",391,71
10,66,interviewer,Okay [laugh],9,2
10,67,participant,"[laugh] Yeah, I quite like, like a freerunner basically go there to there, but they'll put so much shit in it. So inefficient, but a parkour, parkour, person will go, okay, we're gonna go there to, there to there, but we're going to take this huge, inefficient route to go get there. And I quite like that. I like that little definition. But, yeah, so getting back to your question. No, I think I think again, it's sort of like the practicality, it's the fact that you can translate any in- input force out and potentially generate more, which is what lends itself to being used quite a lot.",452,109
10,68,interviewer,"Is it, is it just kind of a bit faster as well, to be able to just do a move straight over an obstacle rather than jump on top, jump down?",104,31
10,69,participant,"No, not necessarily. I mean, arguably, hurdling, something, could be faster. And that, like, rough height, is something that a lot of people can and will do. But yet jumping over it. I mean, yeah, jumping over something over the same obstacle will not give you the right or give you the same trajectory. Right. So, you know, with with the catpass, the fact is, like I said that the hips are going to be up behind you, which means that they're gonna actually be a lot higher than if you jump over it or hurdled the same obstacle because the hips are going to be very close to the wall. And just that change in body position changes the trajectory. And it also means that the momentum is going to go in a different direction, or, yeah, whatever the arc will be. So I don't think, I don't think it's other moves can be faster. But yeah, I think that that's probably the one that's gonna be the fastest or, again, it depends on the situation. If there's a drop on the other side, well, yeah, jumping over it, and then just falling is probably, let gravity do its work, its going to be the fastest route [laugh]",850,209
10,70,interviewer,"It's um, this has been one of the really interesting things about talking to people about this stuff is like we kind of discussed earlier with your metaphor for the car. It's, it seems like such a wide, situationally dependent, almost like a collection of various movements, that somehow all still are labelled Kong.",254,54
10,71,participant,Mm.,2,1
10,72,interviewer,Hmm. It's really interesting.,23,4
10,73,participant,"Yeah, yeah. It's very cool. I mean, this this is why I think that this situation has come across because the, the definition is so loose, and has not really been clear, is not that clear. Um, is the beauty behind it, because people can go well, names really don't matter. To be honest, they they, you know, gives a fuck, you can call it whatever you want, right? But the definition is loose. So you just come up with what you want. And at the end of the day, if it works for you, it works for you. It's just so happens that there are some known ways of performing that particular vault in in a good way. And when I say good, I mean like, for the collective, most people will find the best way of getting over it in that particular way. But some people won't. Some people might find a different way. And it's about like I said, at the beginning the goal of the person and if they want to be able to do it, then yeah, well, there's loose definitions of what that is. And they might have a slightly different definition to what I have. But yeah.",796,204
10,74,interviewer,"I guess the the thing that I find interesting about that is when it comes to coaching, obviously, if you're trying to teach someone something, you have to have a fairly concrete idea of what that thing is to pass it along.",176,42
10,75,participant,Mm. Yeah.,6,2
10,76,interviewer,"But I liked what you said about kind of like the collective, you have, you have like a, almost like a generalised idea that you can adapt to the individual.",123,30
10,77,participant,"Yeah, so it's sort of like I, I kind of see it as like, the bell curve of like, we are sort of like focusing on the middle 80%. Right. So the top and the bottom 10%. They might have their own definitions for things, and I know people that have their own definitions of all that stuff. But we're sort of like going, Okay, I know that the catpass can be performed in that really weird way. Or, you know, what, what not, but really, the majority of people are, want to get that middle kind of ground of, Okay, this is what most people do. And this is the thing that I want to be able to do. So that's what I'm gonna learn, right? And once they've got that, then yeah, they can, they can move up or down and sort of like go, Well, I want to try that version or that version. But really, you've got to have a sort of the base of the pyramid, as it were, you know, you've got to understand the fundamentals first, once you've got that, then you can start playing with the variables, then you can start adding more in and changing things. But you can't really do it from the top down. You can't go Okay, I'm going to, and it doesn't really make sense to do it that way. Right? There's no point in going right, I'm going to learn the I don't know, double catpass to front flip to cat leap. Right, you're not going to go out and go. I'm gonna learn that first. And then once I've got that, I'm going to go back to learning a catpass. It's like, well, what? Yeah, that does doesn't make sense. So yeah.",1116,297
10,78,interviewer,Cool. I think I think that was kind of kind of good in terms of covering a lot of the areas that I like to get to with people. Is there anything else that's kind of popped into your head or the thought of that maybe we didn't get to or you think might be useful to add?,207,58
10,79,participant,"Perhaps more just, like, on like, my, on a personal note, I think that we should have some general guidelines. Like, I'm very aware that parkour, as you've mentioned, has no guidelines, there is no rules, there is no definitions, you know, there might be something on Wikipedia, but you know, but everybody has, like their own ideas and their own variations and things. And as for coaching it, um. You're right, people have no kind of guidelines of what they should be teaching. And I find that's a problem. Because with, with a topic that can cause a lot of harm to people, you have a responsibility to protect anyone that you're you're teaching, right. And I think that the catpass is definitely one of the ones that I see that you know, very often as the one that hurts people the most, because they get taught incorrectly. And as I said that the granularity steps are usually too big. I've seen it so many times with even good coaches, that they it's kind of like this hope and pray sort of thing. I've taught you how to do the movement, you've done it on the ground. Now let's give you a box and pray that you get over it. It's a, it's sort of like, I don't like that. I don't, I just... there is a like you've got to have a little bit of it. But [unclear] at the time, it's way too much than what the coach puts in. And I strongly believe that if we can create all this is what I'm trying to do. You know, tutorials and sort of like, or maybe an established way of teaching something then a lot more coaches will go, Oh, shit, yeah, that's probably a much safer and better way of building up someone's progression. Because, you know, the, there's a standard way of doing it doesn't mean they have to follow it, but at least it gives them ideas of, oh, okay, you know, Polly, who's just come into their class for the first time is not going to stack it and basically, you know, never come back to the class again. Yeah, I definitely feel that we're missing that at the moment. And, and I think actually, a lot of sports do. So weirdly, I was actually thinking about this. Yesterday, I was sitting in Canada Water, and I was watching the skateboarders. And I was like, do they have coaches? The skateboarders, like, I'm sure that like the very high top end, skateboarders have coaches. But if you wanted to learn a trick, how, like, all I can see that they do is they just keep repeat, repeat, repeat until they get it. There is no breakdown, there is no kind of like someone has sat down and gone, okay, what are the component parts of this, maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm completely wrong. But I feel like there are certain sports, especially like, urban sports, the mentality is, just keep doing it until you've done it. You know, it's just like, grind away, keep hurting yourself, until you get that thing. And when you get that thing, you're gonna slowly, you know, understand how it works, and then you'll get it. And I don't know, that just doesn't work for me. So it's just like, nah, man, I get it, because that's how I've done a lot of learning that way. But we're smarter than that. And you know, it, I think that we can bring things like the catpass to people and more people will get it if they can see a structured path to learning it.",2477,615
10,80,interviewer,"Is, um... So I guess I kind of have two questions. Just to follow up from that. One is, you know, you've done coaching, qualification, parkour, coaching qualifications?",128,28
10,81,participant,Mm.,2,1
10,82,interviewer,"Was that stuff part of those courses in any way? Or, like in terms of techniques? Or is it more about-",78,21
10,83,participant,[overlap] No.,9,2
10,84,interviewer,-general coaching knowledge and stuff like that?,40,7
10,85,participant,"Yeah. So the parkour qualifications, which I helped create, as well, where, no, they're not about learning techniques. And, and then, and quite honestly, they shouldn't be, they shouldn't be about, okay, here's a skill. And we're going to just show you the ways of teaching that. No, that's not what a course should be about because quite honestly, that would go on for months [laugh] Very long course of like, every move and everything. No, it, the courses are much more about coaching. Well, the ones that I helped do were much more about the coaching skill, rather than the parkour skill. So it's sort of like, you know, how do you structure classes? How do you make sure everyone's safe? You know, how do you make them enjoyable? How do you develop people? You know, how do you keep engagement, all that kind of stuff, which, especially in parkour, is something a lot of people do not know. And they kind of understand the parkour, but they don't know how to run classes. Because it's two different different skills.",787,181
10,86,interviewer,"I guess my question then is, so if you have someone who's becoming a parkour coach, you know, you've obviously thought a lot about breaking down the Kong vault movement, for example.",144,32
10,87,participant,Yep.,3,1
10,88,interviewer,Where would that coach kind of go for that information? Or is it just on them to develop that themselves?,84,20
10,89,participant,"Right now? Yeah. And that's the problem. That's what the you know, that's what I'm saying that there is nothing out there that does break it all down and structures it and you know, and that's actually something that I want to change. You know, I'm trying to start to change that by putting at least some information out there to go, you know, whether some people agree or not, there's at least something there. But yeah, there's nothing that I know of that would go, for coaches, this, this is a good way of teaching this particular movement. Because I, you know, there are very few people that I actually think, even think about that stuff. So, you know, I kind of see. And I'm not, this is not me kind of picking on just parkour people, I'm picking on all coaches in all disciplines. I see there being sort of like two different groups of coaches, general, but one is the ones that parrot stuff. So it's just like, this is how I learnt. So this is just how I'm going to teach it. Right. This is what my instructor did. And this is, so therefore, I'm going to do it this way. And then there's the ones that actually critically think about it. They're like, why are we doing this? And is there a better way? And maybe the way that I learnt is probably not the best way, maybe there are better ways. And I'm always trying to push towards the second, you know, yes, I do things, obviously, because I've experienced that. I learned things that particular way. And I stick with it, because I actually do think they work. But I've thought about it. And and the problem is I think a lot of coaches come in, and they've not got anything to base their skills on other than what they were taught. So they parrot what they were taught. And, yeah, that leads to a problem. And then you see in all, you know, PTs, for instance, they don't have any experience in the things that they're teaching, and they're just parroting what they've been told. And that the kind of taking the human away from the learning, right? How can you it's like me... writing a book on the third trimester, trimester of birthing, its like, I have no experience of that. You know, who the fuck am I to write about birth? Right? It's sort of the same situation, it's sort of like, until you've experienced it until you've actually thought about it. Yeah, it whether you should be doing or not is like, a bit of an ethical question. I guess.",1841,451
10,90,interviewer,"Are there like, sources you draw on commonly for that kind of thinking about developing your coaching in that way? Or is it just personal experience, experimentation?",136,27
10,91,participant,"A bit of everything. Yeah, there's, I do like to, I think this is more from my kind of IT background. I think because I see things quite linear, which is not always a good thing. I sort of see everything is like a problem and go, Okay, well, there's, there's, I'm good at highlighting the problem and going okay, there's the sticking point is the problem. And then sort of critically sit there staring into space thinking about, okay, how what would be the best way of like solving that problem, and try to kind of come up with as many attack points out of that solution. You know, how many things would break that down? And well, you know, why would that not work? And, if- Oh, and the other thing is, I try not to have an ego in those solutions. So I really, really try and go, I don't care whether I'm wrong. And in fact, I'd prefer to be wrong than right. And if I'm wrong, it just means I haven't got the solution yet. And if it doesn't work, then don't be ashamed to go okay, that's not working. Let's change it. And I think a lot of people can't get into that frame of mind. So they, you know, once they've done something, they've stuck with something, that's it, like they're gonna they're gonna be right. They don't, they don't want to be shown as being wrong or bad. And all that's doing is hurting everybody. So, yeah, you know, there's a lot of things that I have done in my training, that I fucking was so wrong. I was I was so wrong. Like, you know, there were huge parts that I'm just like, I was just being a fucking idiot. Um, but now, maybe as in my old age, I can see. You know, there's no point in doing that. That's just silly. Let's try something else. So I kind of pull in from lots of different sources and I always tend to go with... I don't give a fuck what Parkour is doing quite honestly, I don't care. I should stop swearing for your transcribing. By the way [laugh]",1422,369
10,92,interviewer,It's all good.,10,3
10,93,participant,"Parkour is just too young. Right? Parkour is just way too young, to, for us to know anything about anything. And I don't care what anybody really in Parkour is doing in terms of coaching. Because there was maybe one or two other coaches that I've seen that actually are okay. Yeah, they've really thought about it, like the the Danish guys definitely think about things, you know, deeply. And there's one or two that do. But really, it's better to go just way beyond what we do. And I tend to go, okay, who are the best athletes in the world? In the world? And who are their coaches? And what are they doing? And, trying to figure out who are, yeah, who, or who's doing the best in the world. I know, I'm never gonna get there. But it's sort of like setting your sights, you know, up there, at least I'm going to try, I've got some way to travel, rather than going, Oh, you know, who's the best in parkour at coaching? Is that my goal? Like, you know, it's sort of like, and the, you know, there's so much to learn, and so much to understand that, you know, it's just gonna be a never ending kind of learning curve. But, you know, that's the way it is.",865,223
10,94,interviewer,"And just to just to kind of rewind a tiny bit, but yeah, talking about, you know, having those coaching guidelines and things for coaches. Is there, you know, is there a risk for that of kind of restricting parkour in any way, you know, that you've mentioned the kind of freedom and individual individuality that people can find in the sport?",270,62
10,95,participant,Yeah.,4,1
10,96,interviewer,Do those two things kind of contrast each other-,39,9
10,97,participant,[overlap] No I don't think-,19,5
10,98,interviewer,-or can they co-exist?,16,5
10,99,participant,"No, no, not at all. You know, it's just free and well, not free information, but it's information. What you choose to do with that is up to you. It's not dictating anything, and it's not even, you know, you can't enforce that stuff. You know? So, no, it's, it's not at all. The, the problem is there just isn't anything. So everybody's just sort of like a bit free and wild and whatnot. And if, I always tend to think that quality is king, right, so if you actually bring good quality information, and it makes makes people think, and doesn't treat them like an idiot, then they might see the reason behind why you're doing what you're doing. And therefore, they, they will do it. If you just go Oh, you should do a catpass like this, because I say so. And you shouldn't do it any other way. Where's the logic in that, like, you know, maybe some people will do it. But yeah, it's just not going to last very long. Because people are going to start realising, well, that didn't work. And there's no reasoning behind it. You know, so, yeah, no, I don't I don't think the two are opposites as it were, yeah, both.",830,211
10,100,interviewer,"It's more about putting stuff out there to help people learn or do it safely, but without restricting it.",84,19
10,101,participant,"Yeah, totally. It's just basically going... Hey, guys, this is the definition of a car. How you build your car, you can you can do whatever you like. But, you know, we generally, community, the world considers a car has four wheels and whatnot, you know, it, whether you want to build a motorbike and call it a car, that's totally up to you. But this, this is the sort of like what we consider.",297,75
10,102,interviewer,"Great. I think the sort of thing I've been kind of wrapping up with people with is just to ask, for your own curiosity, you know, what, what, maybe questions do you have about the kong vault or what things might you be interested in finding out about it that you don't know yet? If there's anything?",232,57
10,103,participant,"What would I like to know about it? I think what you're doing, so sort of like the stuff that you're you're at, would be very interesting. Sort of, so generally, I get this is sort of like, most of the information about catpasses is I can figure out for myself and I have figured out for myself, and coaching it, basically, I can figure it out for myself. And really the only two things that I would like, or the two avenues that I kind of like to go down is are the any other methods of teaching or things that other people, other coaches have done, that, you know, I can then consider, and then analyse and go, Okay, I'm gonna try that. See if it works. If it does, then oh cool. Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna use that. So that's the first one. And second thing is like, the highly kind of technical, so the stuff that your doing. So it's sort of like, it would be very interesting, because it means that when you can kind of back things up with, not, not necessarily as like an argument, you know, because that that's the last thing I want to do is argue, you know, how to do something, but it would be nice to know, oh, well, on average 80% of people when they catpass, they do X, Y and Z, right? So it means that well, okay, if I know that, maybe that's the thing I can start off with, with the teaching. And if it doesn't work, then I can go to the other 20% of things, but it sort of allows me to kind of focus what I should be looking at. You know, if, if most if you start to figure out well, most people consider the landing the most difficult part, whereas I usually think that's the most easiest part to teach. If that is the case, then it's going to make me think oh, shit, well, maybe I should spend more time on that. You know, so. Yeah, that information on what you're doing? Yeah. Would be very handy to know. Cool.",1380,363
10,104,interviewer,"All right. I think that's everything. Yeah. Like I said, Is there anything else you want to just add at the end? I'll I'll stop the recording.",107,27
10,105,participant,"Yeah, no, I think I think that's most of the shit that's in my brain [laugh]",55,16
10,106,interviewer,"[laugh] Alright, I'll just stop the recording.",35,7
12,1,interviewer,"All right. So yeah, so the study is, is basically just try me, I'm trying to go out and talk to a bunch of parkour coaches about how they kind of understand the movement and coach it, and maybe how they'd learnt it and stuff for themselves. Considering that, you know, we kind of have this decentralised sport where there isn't a central organisation or rulebook or guideline or something, saying, This is what a movement is. So I'm just really trying to kind of talk to people and see how they have, they've kind of built that understanding for themselves, or within the community. I just kind of picked the Kong vault as a kind of well known movement, and like a good choice to start with. So I guess the first thing to kind of check is, is Kong vault, you know, does that sound familiar to you?",623,150
12,2,participant,"Yeah, it is. I would say that's probably one of the first vaults that I learned, starting out. And it's one of the most commonly used ones too I'd say, in, you know, any parkour gym.",136,36
12,3,interviewer,"And I guess, kind of just, in your own words, how would you, how would you describe the movement?",74,19
12,4,participant,"So, just step by step, I'd say that approaching an obstacle, you would jump with sort of your chest down, and arms, about shoulder width apart, hands on top of the obstacle, your hips up, knees bent almost to your chest, and you just carry your legs through the vault. And through your hands. And, yeah, and then just step out of it.",256,63
12,5,interviewer,"Are there, um, and are there like, particular ways that you take off for the movement?",67,16
12,6,participant,"There's, there's two ways there's, you know, like a punch with your feet together, and then you step into it, I would say I step into it more than a punch, unless I'm doing maybe a double Kong or a dive kong.",156,42
12,7,interviewer,"Is there a, is there a difference between those two kind of approaches?",57,13
12,8,participant,"Yeah, so a dive Kong is, when you do sort of a longer jump, the obstacles a lot larger, so you're going over a longer distance. So you're, you're diving through the air, hence the name, dive kong, to get over, you know, a longer obstacle and with a double Kong, you are placing your hands down at two separate points. So they go down for the first kong, but your body is still in the air, you don't carry your knees through. And then while you're still going over the obstacle, you place your hands down again, and then bring your knees through.",418,104
12,9,interviewer,"And you mentioned like the punch takeoff, and the kind of staggered feet, takeoff, kind of two foot. What did, how do they kind of change your takeoff?",118,28
12,10,participant,"I would say with a punch, you get more power. So a lot of beginners are going to use punch more to get more height. Especially when you're when you're first learning Kong vault, you're going to want to get a lot more height to carry your, your legs through. So um, yeah, if, like when I was beginning, I used to punch a lot, but now I'm more used to the movement. So I do the staggered step into it. And it's a lot easier, it just flows better. Especially if you're running right at the obstacle, you don't have to take a hop into the punch, you can just step into it.",430,114
12,11,interviewer,"Does it make a difference to to the movement as a whole? Does it change things about you know, how you how the rest of the movement takes takes place? Or is it just kind of, it's easier to run into?",152,41
12,12,participant,I would say it's just easier to run into.,31,9
12,13,interviewer,"And so you know, you mentioned dive, going forward onto the hands. Are they contributing to the movement as well or are they just kind of tapping the obstacles you go past?",137,32
12,14,participant,"Um, on a regular Kong and a dive Kong, you will be taking a lot of impact on your hands. Because you know you're just you're placing your hands down once, but in a double Kong, when you place your hands down the first time is just going to be usually a soft tap, maybe a little bit of push to give you more height. And then the second time you put your hands down you're gonna be taking all the impact and so, um, yeah, I would say just mostly, most Kongs are just going to have one soft tap, maybe a little bit of push to carry you over [unclear]",419,112
12,15,interviewer,"So as most of your kind of power in the movement coming from the, from the legs from the jump beforehand?",83,21
12,16,participant,Yeah.,4,1
12,17,interviewer,"Yeah. And how about coming off the other side of the obstacle? Is it, is there a particular way to come out of the movement as well?",102,27
12,18,participant,"Yeah, best way's to step out, but a lot of beginners, you know, when they land, they're gonna kind of stutter, they're going to not be used to the impact so that their knees might bend or fold a little. And that's, you know, typically when they're chest comes back, that awkward landing, but the more you get used to it, the more you'll, you'll realise that you know, your, your chest is down the entire way through. So when you land, your momentum is carried forward, and your balance is kept by keeping your chest low.",398,97
12,19,interviewer,"Is that important? Coming out the movement, that balance?",46,9
12,20,participant,"Very important, yeah, especially if you are going into something right after a kong.",68,14
12,21,interviewer,"Is that common to kind of connect it up with other stuff, or...?",47,13
12,22,participant,"I would say so yeah. Usually, especially in an urban environment, you're gonna want to connect it with something, you know, there's one wall, there's bound to be more, so.",131,30
12,23,interviewer,"Mm. You mentioned like, you know, dive kong and double Kong and stuff. Do you kind of consider these like, distinct moves are they or are they all just kind of variations on the same movement?",151,36
12,24,participant,"I would call them all variations. And, you know, they are they are all kongs. But there's, you know, a tonne of different kongs you can do, you can do if a 360 Kong, which is where in your movement while diving towards the kong, you rotate your body a complete 360 degrees and then kong through, you can do a Kong gainer, which would be to Kong vault, but then going right into a backflip after by just using your hands. So yeah, there are tonnes and tonnes of variations on.",368,92
12,25,interviewer,"What, what's kind of like, the common common thing shared between these variations, like what makes something a kong versus giving it a completely different name?",132,26
12,26,participant,"The defining quality of a kong would be placing your hands down about shoulder width and carrying your knees through. [unclear] there's any other vaults like that, that are called kongs.",150,31
12,27,interviewer,"Is it a little bit kind of, you know, when you see it, it's...?",42,14
12,28,participant,"Yeah, I would say so. I'd say, when you see a kong, you're gonna say that's a kong or some variation of a kong.",80,24
12,29,interviewer,"And so I'm curious, you know, you said, I think at the start, that was one of the first moves you learnt, did you teach yourself? Or did you have, go to classes or anything like that? How did you kinda learn it?",159,43
12,30,participant,"Um, I started in, in my backyard, just, you know, looking at parkour videos on YouTube. And I wouldn't say that I was actually doing parkour then I was just kind of sort of building up to it. And then I started going to a gym, about 20 minutes away from me. And that's when I started learning more official, clean forms and techniques.",259,64
12,31,interviewer,"How did you, what kind of things did you kind of learn about the movement, going from self taught to, I guess, what were you taught about the movement? Was there anything that sticks out? Or...?",149,36
12,32,participant,"Yeah, I learned control a lot more. And like I said, earlier, I learned that, you know, there's different ways to approach it. There's different ways to come out of the vault. And there's tonnes of variations that I've learned on it. And I'm still learning more even six years later.",218,51
12,33,interviewer,Did you find it easy to learn or difficult?,34,9
12,34,participant,"In the beginning, it was pretty easy, especially in the gym I was in it was, um, it was newly parkoured gym. It started at first as a gymnastics gym. So there were spring floor mats everywhere. So it was a very safe environment. But yeah, as I learned more variations, I would say it definitely got a lot harder.",242,60
12,35,interviewer,"So is it like a movement, you can you can progress to quite advanced things?",60,15
12,36,participant,"Yeah, yeah, you can, you can start with, you know, the regular Kong vault, and then you can experiment with that, put it into lines, try variations of it, things like that.",131,32
12,37,interviewer,"Is it, is it quite like a useful vault, in general? I know, it's quite a broad term but, you know.",71,21
12,38,participant,"Yeah I would say, yeah, it's probably maybe my go to if I'm not thinking about it, if I'm at a certain speed, like, I'm going pretty fast, too fast to do something comfortable, I'm probably just going to use a kong vault.",166,43
12,39,interviewer,"And is that just because you, you're very comfortable with it? Or do you think it just applies itself to a lot of situations?",98,24
12,40,participant,"Um, probably both, I'm very used to it, it's a comfortable move, and it can be applied to any situation where you are just going in a straight line, you are needing to go straight over that obstacle, your best bet will probably be kong vault.",188,46
12,41,interviewer,"In comparison to like other vaults commonly used in parkour, it's, it's just very, um, particular fast, or efficient, or...?",93,20
12,42,participant,"I would say it's a combination of efficiency, and speed. So vaults like a dash vault, where you you jump up, and you kick your feet out, before your feet or before your hands touch the obstacle, that has a little bit more danger to it, a lot more speed. But with a Kong vault, there's an element of safety where you, you can always keep your feet under you if you mess up so you can catch yourself. And your hands will always be out in front of you.",346,90
12,43,interviewer,"Do you find, the, I mean, just because you mentioned safety there [cough] Excuse me, do you find it, when you're coaching it now, is it a movement that people, you know, learn pretty easily or are they, do they find it difficult at all?",179,45
12,44,participant,"I would say most people find it generally easy to get down sort of, a, once you get over the feeling of it, get used to it, it just becomes natural. But it also depends on the size of the obstacle, how tall or even how short sometimes it can be difficult to Kong vault over a smaller obstacle. So it sort of depends on...",247,65
12,45,interviewer,"So it depends on the the individual and the environment where they're learning it. Sorry, excuse me one second [cough] Sorry. I've been doing a lot of talking today and my throat, I think my voice is starting to give up. Okay, do you find when people you know, come to classes and stuff that it's it's a movement they've already know, as beginners they've seen it somewhere else, or?",296,70
12,46,participant,"Well, in my particular gym, most of the people coming there are relatively new to the sport, they don't really have a lot of experience. And usually they're they're younger too sort of 10 to 16 years old. So they have little to no experience in vaults. And generally they just want to get right to the flips. They want to learn how to do that. But typically, they they're not going to really know how to do it. So they have to learn first.",340,85
12,47,interviewer,"What about, do you coach any adults or older, like teenagers as well?",54,13
12,48,participant,"Yeah, briefly, for some time, we had some adult classes at my gym. We weren't getting a lot of attention, the adults not not many going into classes so [unclear]",124,30
12,49,interviewer,"Ok. And I guess the reason I kind of asked those kind of questions is I'm curious whether it's kind of become a bit of a famous parkour move, like if people recognise it as parkour ,I don't know, do you think it's a recognisably parkour movement, or is it-",197,50
12,50,participant,"I, I would say that if you have been doing parkour for at least... at least like a year, you're probably going to recognise it. You know that that comes to the difference between parkour and freerunning where a lot of people say, oh, they're the same thing. And then you have typically more traditional people who say Parkour is mainly flips, people like that are going to recognise a Kong vault, much more than someone who's say strictly does freerunning [unclear] recognisable.",380,83
12,51,interviewer,"Do you think it's, it's quite like, erm, I don't want to say like, important, but like, is it, is it something that you would encourage people com ingto the sport to learn? Is it like, not important, what's the word, like useful movement for people to learn?",195,48
12,52,participant,Yeah.,4,1
12,53,interviewer,Like a fundamental movement?,24,4
12,54,participant,"Yeah, I would absolutely say that it's fundamental. It's one of the basics, everybody should learn it in the beginning. Even even if you don't want to, it's just a good one for the repertoire, even if you're not going to use it a lot. Because having that skill, just even a basic Kong can translate into other skills like a kash vault, which is the combination of a dash vault and a Kong vault, where you start like you would a Kong vault, and then kick into a dash. Obviously important to do that you're going to want to learn how to do a kong vault.",426,107
12,55,interviewer,"So is there like, a basic version that you can then progress into the things like the double Kong and all the other variations? There's like, yeah, just like a basic Kong, that people start out learning?",160,37
12,56,participant,"Yeah, just just a basic, regular kong, is what, you know, if we were teaching that in my gym, we would just start out with basic simple Kongs. And if anybody wanted to try more advanced type, like a double Kong, kash vaults, something like that, we would set up a longer obstacle, or two obstacles for them to experiment and try it out on while keeping the other simple, you know, Kong vault obstacle up for everybody to just practise on.",342,82
12,57,interviewer,"Mm. Are there ways to kind of break down the basic one for those that perhaps aren't learning it straightaway, is there ways to make it easier or build up to it?",126,32
12,58,participant,"Yeah, there. There is progressions and techniques, you can use, probably one of the most helpful progressions would be just practising it with no obstacle at all just on the ground, pointing your hands on the floor and bringing your knees through them. And then slowly, just getting used to your knees, going through your arms like that, remembering technique, which would be keeping your hips up, in order to bring your legs through, and everything you're going to need for that you're going to need speed to carry yourself completely through. I see a lot of a lot of people don't have enough speed, so they just get stuck right over the obstacle.",517,114
12,59,interviewer,"So with with speed, is it kind of learning to, I think it's, I think you might have said some of this earlier, but like learning to kind of commit to, to going into it with some some power, I guess.",150,41
12,60,participant,"Yeah, yeah, you're definitely gonna need at least some element of power to complete it. Because no matter how, you know, short the obstacle is, you are still going to want to be able to carry yourself over it. And that means keeping your feet up and moving at a faster rate.",214,52
12,61,interviewer,"I'm curious as well, with the with the floor exercise that you mentioned, what is it that people are getting used to? Is it is it like they trying to get more flexible to get their knees up to the chest? Or are they trying to push off with the hands?",194,51
12,62,participant,"Yeah, I would say I guess you can call it a stretch, but mostly it's just getting used to having your knees up to your chest. And so if I would, if somebody wanted to learn a Kong vault, I would tell them practice that floor exercise, as well as other ones such as donkey kicks, which is where you place your hands flat on the floor and you sort of kick your feet up and then back down into a crouch position with your knees to your chest, and just uh, practice. There's a tonne of different names for this but I call them monkey ups or Kong ups you could call them, where you you almost go into a Kong vault, but you don't carry yourself through, you place your hands on top of the obstacle and bring your knees knees up to your chest, just so that your feet get on top of you.",604,157
12,63,interviewer,"So just kind of getting used to replacing the hands with the feet almost. Yeah. Well, are there any like particular, sticking points that you've, you kind of see people commonly get stuck with?",153,34
12,64,participant,"Commitment is always a big issue a lot of people one, run right up to it, place their hands down and then just stop. Especially on double kongs,  if it's hard to tell if you can't make the distance or if you think you might not be able to. And a lot of people when they go into a kong, they don't get their feet up enough, which requires just your hips to kind of go high up. But if your hips are too low, then your feet are gonna clip the edge, and you're just gonna take a spill.",366,100
12,65,interviewer,"So when you kind of moved into coaching, from just practising for yourself, did you, erm, you know, all the kind of talking about Kongs that we've been doing, is that just you've developed that yourself? Or is that been in conversation with other coaches as well? Or with other practitioners? How does how does your kind of knowledge of the movement develop?",284,63
12,66,participant,"Um, I would say it mostly developed when I first started classes, and then it came back around more into a conversation topic when I started coaching and had to teach it again. I would watch people who were learning I'd watch them go through the vault, and then break it down with the other people who wanted to learn. And there are a tonne of places that you can find breakdowns of this vault. Before I started going to classes, when I was just kind of jumping around my backyard, I would watch Tapp Brothers on YouTube. And they would do multiple breakdowns, many different vaults and Kong vault was one of them.",489,114
12,67,interviewer,So do you find now when you're coaching that you kind of take that stuff and pass it along to your students? Or is it changed or developed over the years?,121,31
12,68,participant,"Some of it changes. It's not that I like disagree, per se, with any anybody that would, you know, break it down, I would just teach it differently, especially depending on who I'm dealing with. Because not everybody's gonna have the same problems, not everybody's gonna have the same mentality. So.",233,51
12,69,interviewer,"So you kind of adapt it to the student that you have. And, but it's still kind of your, I guess, you know, as you're part of, you know, group of coaches, do you guys talk about this and share this stuff with each other as well?",170,47
12,70,participant,"Not typically, unless it's a variation, more complicated variation, like a Kong gainer. We're gonna break it down to help each other learn a bit more. But since we're all coaches, and we all pretty much know that move, we don't really talk about it too much.",200,47
12,71,interviewer,"I guess I mean, in terms of coaching it to other people, do you talk about it as coaches and say, this is how I like to coach it, or?",99,30
12,72,participant,"Ah. Yeah, yeah, sometimes, every so often you get like a difference of what needs to be fixed between two coaches, and one student. So say, for instance, me and one of my co workers would be working with a student on their Kong vault. And, you know, I could say, Oh, you need to go back to your progressions, you need to learn about how to get your speed or get your hips up. And then my coworker could say, No, you just need more speed, you know, sometimes it just differs on what we're seeing how we're seeing it. But generally, we're all going to have the same progression progressions to give out and exercises to build strength, just stuff like that were pretty much the same things.",533,130
12,73,interviewer,"Is that because those other coaches may have learned from the same places as you, or is it just because that's kind of naturally evolved as like this is a good way to teach it?",139,35
12,74,participant,"I would say just because that's the natural way of teaching it you know, there's there's only so many things you can do wrong with the Kong vault. And every every person that I've worked with, has given very similar advice.",175,41
12,75,interviewer,"Do you think it's just kind of, er, I don't know, common sense prevails? And people just kind of get these ideas of this is this is working and pass it along?",120,32
12,76,participant,"Yeah. Mostly it can be just considered common sense. It could. It could be as simple as just visually, you know, seeing what's wrong with how the person is doing the vault and then telling them what needs to change with it. Or, you know, if they realise what they need to change, but they still can't physically change it. Taking them back to progressions is pretty much what every coach will do.",311,73
12,77,interviewer,"Does that kind of ability to assess come from, like, just experience and practice, or...",68,15
12,78,participant,"I don't think so, I've talked to a lot of people who say they they have a struggle with seeing what somebody is doing, and then being able to translate what they're doing or what they need to fix. A lot of a, lot of people I train with, say they couldn't be a coach, because they don't know how to translate the movement into a lesson.",257,67
12,79,interviewer,So is that is that like an extra skill that coaches have? That has developed somehow?,68,16
12,80,participant,"Yeah, usually, coaches are going to have some extra. Yeah, I guess you'd call it extra skill that helps them teach, tell students what they need to do to fix a certain, like the ability to assess, break down and analyse what a student's doing, how they're doing it wrong, or if they're doing it right.",232,56
12,81,interviewer,"Are there any common things with the Kong vault that you might look at to do that assessment, anything you like, Yeah, that that was a really good one. Or vice versa. That was a really bad one.",150,38
12,82,participant,"Yeah, I'm always gonna watch the arms, the hips and the knees, or I guess just the legs, because typically, if somebody is doing a kong wrong, it's like, if they're clearing the obstacle, but they're still doing it wrong, it's looking kind of too stiff, too rigid, it's usually going to be either what they're doing during the vault, which has something to do with their arm placement, hip height, or knees coming through, or it has to do with their takeoff. So if I was teaching a student and their kong, was choppy, you know, they would kind of punch into it too hard, and land too hard, let's say their hips are going too high, because their punch was too hard. So they were going in the air too high, taking too much impact on their arms. And then when they land, they're, you know, kind of pushing themselves forward too much. And landing kind of in that position where they're not, you know, they don't have enough momentum, I would say, carry more speed into it. Don't punch so hard. So you don't go as high you want to go over the obstacle like this, not like this.",822,202
12,83,interviewer,"So it just because I'm going to transcribe it, just to put it in words, kind of like a fairly shallow arc over the obstacle, you don't want to go up too up and then down on the other side?",143,40
12,84,participant,"Exactly, because the more more high of an arc that you have, the more impact you're taking, which is stopping you from moving forward, but but the more shallow the arc is, the more you're going to be able to continue your momentum.",181,43
12,85,interviewer,"So kind of minimising the amount of up and down that you have to do, letd you keep that horizontal speed, I guess. And I like that you said, used the word choppy as well. So kind of if it's very stop-start, is that you mean, like you want like a smooth?",192,53
12,86,participant,"Yeah, sort of flowy movement.",23,5
12,87,interviewer,"And are there, like, are there certain ways that you might spot the movement for people when you're teaching it to them or do you just let them go for it?",120,31
12,88,participant,"I would usually after progressions, if they look confident with it, and if they're telling me they're comfortable enough to try it. I would say go ahead and just go for it. I don't really know any ways to spot a kong vault besides just I guess, putting a mat down behind the obstacle, so if they have a bad landing, you know, they'll be caught. But, yeah, I would just say, if you feel like you can do it, just go for it, exercise caution, as always.",343,88
12,89,interviewer,"Yeah, to kind of make sure that you, you've maybe satisfied yourself that they are ready for that. But at some point, you just have to let them try it. In a way, yeah. Cool. Are there any kind of like coaching cues that you might give? Anything that come like, comes up often?",211,54
12,90,participant,"Any coaching, what?",15,3
12,91,interviewer,"Coaching cues, like common things that you might say to someone, like, keep your chest up or something.",82,18
12,92,participant,"For Kong vault, specifically?",24,4
12,93,interviewer,Mm.,2,1
12,94,participant,"Hips are the most important. And I think that's really hard for a lot of people to understand. Because you don't really think about your hips through movement and your focus on your arms, what you see right in front of you, you're not going to focus on but your hips have to come up in order to get your knees through. So you don't clip your feet. And yeah, like, like I said before, also keeping your chest down. So you're not you're not coming up too hard on the ending and sort of choking the landing, you want to keep your chest down, hips up, to carry through.",436,110
12,95,interviewer,"With the with the hips up thing, why is it do you think people might struggle with that?",69,18
12,96,participant,"Because, well, feet clipping is one of the most common mistakes when you're doing a Kong vault, it's usually going to happen when you start trying it. And I think it's a common mistake. Because when, like I said before, when you're going over the obstacle, you're focused on what you see in front of you, not what you see behind you, so you focus on the hands, you're focused on the obstacle, you're not really thinking about your legs or your hips, because you don't even see them per se, so you have to, in that moment, listen to your body, more than your mind. And I wouldn't say that for most of [unclear]",466,115
12,97,interviewer,"And what kind of thing would you would you do to kind of help someone with that hip, hip raise, if they were struggling?",94,24
12,98,participant,"Um, I would give them different progressions to do, I think most coaches would do that, sort of go back to the drawing board, I'd even what helps a lot of times, especially with myself, I found is that taking a video of the mistake, and showing it to that person, they'll see what they're doing wrong. And in their mind, they'll be like, Okay, so that's what I have to do, because sometimes describing it only gets you so far. And they might not even know what you mean, until they actually see it themselves.",393,96
12,99,interviewer,"It's very, um, very visual. Yeah, I can see that they can assess themselves almost a little bit.",73,18
12,100,participant,Yeah.,4,1
12,101,interviewer,"Mm. So we've actually covered a lot of the questions that I like to try and ask people, which is great. It's been very quick, very, to the point, which is great. Some people say a lot for some of these questions. I'm curious, really just for yourself. So there, is there anything about the movement that you you know, would like to know more about? Or is it you're curious about for the movement?",304,75
12,102,participant,"What I would really like to do at some point and this is part of the main reason that I'm going to college for exercise science is that I would love to be able to put on one of those like little suits with the dots on it and have cameras record me going through the movement of a Kong vault to see specifically maybe how it's different from other people's, take a closer in depth look a bit maybe see what muscles are specifically contracting. And let's say if I you know, had a problem with my Kong vault, I could see specifically what muscles needed to be improved in order to get stronger, cos there would be no way of knowing completely what specific muscles to improve. Let's say I was in, I wanted to do a double Kong, but I wasn't pushing hard enough with my arms or absorbing the landing correctly with my arms on the second kong that I would say just off the top of my head, I would say, triceps would be a huge part of that. But let's say I didn't know that, a video recording of that in depth, while wearing that suit would show me the impact taken on the second kong. And it would show me that all this impact can't be absorbed. But building those muscles, and getting used to that movement would allow me to absorb it better. So push ups, handstand push ups, things like that wouldn't help build those specific muscles.",1047,256
12,103,interviewer,I can't remember if we actually discussed it. But is strength important to the Kong vault then? Or is it more technique?,95,22
12,104,participant,"For a simple Kong vault, I would say it's all technique. But a lot of variations take a lot more strength. Even even just a dive Kong is gonna require a little bit more leg strength for the speed to run up to it. And launching yourself. It's just gonna take a little bit more muscle strength.",228,57
12,105,interviewer,"And do you have, um, yeah, you mentioned putting on the suit, the suit with the dots on it and stuff? Do you have any kind of theories you'd like to test out? You know, beyond muscle strength? Is there anything about it that you're like, really curious about? Because I'll be honest, it's the kind of thing that I want to do as well. So I'm really curious what people that are interested in, in the movement. You know, you mentioned strength, is there anything else about the movement, you're curious about?",391,93
12,106,participant,"I would say for this movement, not particularly, I'm pretty confident in my form and technique for it. But in a lot of other movements, I'd love to break down, you know, especially certain flips, I'd love to see how specifically the body knows when to open up, when to land, especially on these blind landings. Like, like front flips, the body just sort of opens up at the right moment, after a lot of experience with that flip. You just, it's just body instinct and spatial awareness. You know, what you're doing on vaults to you know, a person who's been doing Kong vaults for a long time, won't even look at the obstacle. They're just their eyes are straight ahead. And they're just right over it. So it sort of begs the question, how do they know? What's there? By not even looking at spatial awareness, experience and instinct?",645,151
12,107,interviewer,"Yeah, it just kind of, I guess, does that that kind of level of confidence come from just experience and repetition? Do you think?",102,24
12,108,participant,"Yeah, for sure, I'd say so my gym likes to talk about how you haven't truly mastered a flip unless you've done it 1000 times. And I think that applies to vaults as well, because you can do a Kong vault once. And you know, your first Kong vault can be very messy and, and you can't really say oh, you know, I completely mastered it. No [unclear] I don't think there is a specific point, though, when you master a vaults, or a flip, I think, just one day, you're going to realise I'm so comfortable with this, I've mastered it.",396,102
12,109,interviewer,"Yeah, its, um. Yeah, I find that confidence is really a big part of it. Because he there is that commitment of diving onto something. Yeah. Do you think then for the like, really, really advanced practitioners... Like, there's just more, they're just more committed to the movement? And that's why they can do these incredible things, or is it technique improvement?",285,62
12,110,participant,"I would say it's, it's a wide combination of a lot of things. So people who are very comfortable with Kongs, have done it a lot of times so they're used to the movement, and they've probably done a lot of more difficult things, more difficult variations. And that really helps a lot with confidence. You know, if you can do a double kong, you can certainly do a single kong. So in that instance, you're not going to be too worried about doing a similar kong, cos [unclear] confidence, I think wouldn't be problem for that specific vault, if you're more experienced and you can do more difficult things.",469,110
12,111,interviewer,"Is there, is there anything else that's kind of popped into your head or you thought at any point, while we've been talking that we didn't get chance to get to? Or that you'd like to, to add?",145,38
12,112,participant,"Um, no, I think so.",12,5
12,113,interviewer,"I just remembered one other question. I'm sorry. So, as a as a coach as well, now, do you, um, you know, we've talked about how you've kind of developed the movement and then slightly changed things for coaching and maybe talk to other coaches about it and stuff. Do you think that it's something that would be useful for coaches to have to have like something to refer to to, to talk about, this is a good way to coach the Kong? Or do you think it's good that people just have their own personal experiences that inform how they coach or...",419,103
12,114,participant,"I think personal experiences are very important, especially because they can give you a different look on what a student might need. So if everything was, if I say this, if the way to teach a Kong vault was completely, you know, the same completely flat for every single student, I think a lot of students would not be able to do it, because students need to learn differently. So they, they might need a different environment to learn it in, they might need different obstacles to learn it from, they might even just need different progressions. So your own personal personal experiences influencing the way you coach are very important. Because if you meet a student that needs to learn the same way you learned or needs to practice the same way you practice, you can then use that for them. But if you learned one way, in one way only, and they need to learn a different way. It would be nice to have another coach with the same experiences and personal experience that they need to learn.",793,180
12,115,interviewer,"I'm curious, what about if you had a student who doesn't respond to the way that you learnt it, and maybe there wasn't another coach, that you know, if it was if you're the only coach in the area. You know, how would you kind of, I guess, as a coach, get those other experiences or get that wider knowledge base to coach more people who aren't necessarily all learning it the same way you are.",303,76
12,116,participant,"I would, I would try to see the obstacle and see the vault from the students point of view, I tried to, literally try to do the vault with the exact same mistakes they're making, to feel how it feels to do what they're doing. And when I know how to correctly do that vault. I can say, Okay, here's the difference. I know what it feels like. So maybe I wouldn't even be able to see what they're doing wrong. But if I try and do it the way they're doing it, I can feel it and then I can tell them how to change it.",387,107
12,117,interviewer,"Mm. Cool. Um, yeah, I know I already asked this but just in case anything came up in that last question. Is there anything anything more you'd like to to add? Or that you sort of you, might throw in?",151,40
12,118,participant,Uhh.... [shakes head],13,3
12,119,interviewer,"Cool. In that case then yeah, we've we've kind of gone through, gone through pretty quick. Hit all the all the kind of areas I like to try and get to with people. So yeah, if there's nothing else I'll stop the recording. Yeah. Cool.",175,45
14,1,interviewer,"There we go. Alright, so, yeah, so as the kind of information sheet I sent over said I'm just kind of interested in talking to some parkour coaches out there about how they understand some of the movements that we do in parkour. Bearing in mind how, you know, it's kind of a decentralised sport, you know, it's not like a central organisation or rulebook or something, saying, Hey, this is what this movement is for parkour. And just kind of seeing how people may have learnt the moves, how they coach them, how they understand and things like that. There was something else I was gonna say that was it. Oh, no, no. Yeah. So just kind of having a conversation with people. I guess the first place to kind of start in that case, is just asking what, is the, oh that's right. And so I picked Kong vault, just as like a kind of well known movement to start with. But I guess the, yeah, the first thing to check is, is Kong vault the term that you're familiar with? Is that how you know the movement?",769,190
14,2,participant,"Yeah. So I, I learned it as a Kong vault. I am aware of some other terminology, like a monkey vault, that there's some dispute over if those names refer to the same movement, or not, at least in my region. But I know it as the Kong vault. Yeah, that's the that's the term that we call it by. Yeah.",222,61
14,3,interviewer,"What, what's the dispute? Do you know? Like, is it what's the other move it might be?",62,17
14,4,participant,"So so my understanding is that the kong is sometimes the name used for a movement where you're, you're diving at the obstacle, and you're airborne before your hands make contact. And a monkey, by contrast, is just it's essentially exactly the same movement, but you're not airborne. So you're going like your feet are still planted, and your hands plant. And so you've got like four points of contact, and then you go over it. Yeah, I've never really cared for that distinction that much like nitpicking in parkour. It's all Kong to me, but [laugh]",427,97
14,5,interviewer,"Okay. I mean, I guess, you know, you started doing so already. But how would you, how would you describe the movement? In that case, for a Kong vault?",113,29
14,6,participant,"In general terms, I would say a Kong is... how do I keep this simple, uh...",52,16
14,7,interviewer,"No no, don't worry about that. Go as complicated as you want, it's all good.",56,15
14,8,participant,"I would say a vault designed for obstacles, anywhere for, from knee to chin height, where you're hands are the only contact or your body go over sort of in a tucked position, right. I would say that's, that's kind of the best I can do right now. So that, but.",197,51
14,9,interviewer,"So if you were if you were going to, like really break the movement down, maybe like the, you know, the takeoff for the movement, if you know, the, you know, the landing how, how are there like common versions of that, are there variations. How would you describe kind of more than just the basic movement?",238,57
14,10,participant,"Right. Okay. So just just so that I understand you, right, because you did cut out a little bit. How would I how would I describe like, how would I break apart the movement? You know, like, how would I describe the landing and the execution or the takeoff? The execution of the landing? Correct. And are there commonalities? Okay, yeah. So, yeah, I mean, I would for a student. I mean, I wouldn't really focus on those things too much. I tend to like teaching in a very broad sort of vague sense and let the students figure it out on their own, but I think I mean, if this is what you're asking, I'm not sure if my answer is going to. I'm not sure if I'm answering the right question. But I know the takeoff from two punch where you're, you do a little hop, both feet hit the ground simultaneously, and you use that as the impetus for the movement. Or you can do like a split step or any, any of the many names for like a like a one, two left, right, and you're coming off of one foot and swing the other like the back foot up and behind. I'm sure there are, you know, other other nuances that we can get into but those are kind of the two major categories of entering movement. I'm not sure if you want me to go into like, angles and [unclear]",949,246
14,11,interviewer,"Yeah, as much detail as you want to go into, it's, what I'm curious about really is obviously, and a little bit this has been informed by my talking to other people already so far is there's a huge amount of variation that could go into the movement. So what what is it that makes a Kong vault a Kong vault? If there's so much that could chop and change?",274,70
14,12,participant,"Right, right. That's, I like that question. That's good. Yeah, you know, I think I would say, for me, a kong, distilled into like, its purest form, right? Like the the most basic components of that movement would be really any vault where your hands are the only point of contact, and there's some form of like, how do I say this, it's, it's, you're limited by, like, regardless of the approach or which foot you go off of, or even if your hands hit at the same time. The core of the movement really is, hands are the only point of contact, generally at the same time, and your body goes through that space. Right? Whether that's at an angle, I mean, just, what is today, Thursday? Just on Tuesday, I was doing Kongs diagonally, where the obstacle itself was kind of at a weird slant. And I couldn't go through in the conventional way. Right, uh, perfectly perpendicular to the obstacle, and so I'm kind of slant. And by virtue of that slant, I wasn't going through that space between my arms perfectly, sort of straight, if that makes sense. Yeah, I don't know. It's, I think it is kind of, in some ways, the tough question, right? Because there's so many different ways to slice it. But yeah, both hands down, body through the space between the hands. Everything else is kind of miscellaneous and contextual. So",1005,240
14,13,interviewer,"Is it, s it kind of one of those things where you know it when you see it? It's-",58,19
14,14,participant,Yeah.,4,1
14,15,interviewer,It's a little bit open?,17,5
14,16,participant,"Yeah. Sorry. Yeah, no, I mean, I think it's very distinctive. You know, I mean, anybody who knows, parkour knows what a Kong vault looks like, whether or not they know to attach the name, kong, right to that movement, just because it's so iconic. And I think, I mean, it would be kind of fun to figure out where where does that recognition break down? Right? How much can you change the Kong before it stops being a kong? Like visually, right, but yeah, yeah, I don't know. I, I'm sorry. What was your original question? I kind of got lost along the way.",418,105
14,17,interviewer,I'm not sure.,9,3
14,18,participant,All right [laugh],13,3
14,19,interviewer,"So it's like, you know, I do want this to be like a conversation. So if the answers lead us off to places, then then that's great. It's all good. All right. So I'm curious, you know, if you were where do you feel like maybe you learnt the movement? Or can you remember learning the movement?",220,57
14,20,participant,"Yeah, I can, that's, that's actually a very distinct memory for me. Mainly, because the Kong was the first movement, I think, that I really learned that was really sort of ingrained into, into my way of moving. So I learned the Kong in a public park in, in the city, and it was on a, on a concrete picnic table, right? It was probably like, six or seven feet long, and you know, two or three feet wide. And we started at, oh, how do I say this at the end of one of the tables, so facing down the length of the table. And the the procedure was to plant the hands, like come right up to the edge of the table, right, basically hips on the, on the edge, hands down. And then just to kind of hop up without moving the hands, trying to get the hips as high as possible. And then from there, you know, adding on things like okay, you know, shift your weight into your hands, get the hips up, and then tuck the knees and then just come straight back down. And then from there, you know, hips up, tuck, and then feet land between the hands, just to kind of get used to that, that idea of, you know, pitching forward and moving into this crouched position. And then after that, it was just a gradual process of like, okay, to take a step back, step into it, hop up onto the table, take a few more steps back, get a bit more more than that and see if you can get your feet farther than your hands and then it just kind of builds naturally and then from there. Yeah. You know, running it to dive kongs and is and, and all sorts of different fun things. But that was that was the main sort of mode of instruction for that movement.",1236,323
14,21,interviewer,So we're you being taught that by somebody or we just experimenting for yourself?,66,14
14,22,participant,"No, no, I was I was being taught by [name], I think I mentioned him in the, in the information sheet. He is kind of like a mentor. That's kind of a good word. I mean, he's, he's known him for, like, the entire time that I've been doing parkour, but he was very definitely like, the, you know, the instructor, the teaching, like figure, right? Just because he'd been doing it, and I hadn't, and so he was like, Okay, here's the movement, do it, you know, do it again, you know, just the classic, you know, do it until you drop, and then, and that's good enough for one day, and then do it again tomorrow.",442,118
14,23,interviewer,"Did you, did you find it easy to learn or hard?",35,11
14,24,participant,"I remember it. I think it clicked, I would say it was easy. And whether that's a product of just the, like how natural Parkour is as a movement form, or just just that it worked with my like, my, the shape of my body and the way that I was thinking about movement at the time? I don't know. But yeah, you know, it made sense. It clicked, it was not difficult.",271,73
14,25,interviewer,"It, slightly, like different to easy, or difficult. Was it scary?",50,11
14,26,participant,"No, I don't remember it being frightening. Exhilarating, maybe. And I was aware of the potential for danger, but it wasn't like, you know, ooh I don't want to, like, I'm hesitant to do this, because I'm worried about like, you know, smashing my nose, clipping my shins or something. Because I that, I think, because I knew I could do it. But I've had students who I mean, so many of my students are really hesitant to, to go into a kong and learn it, I think, because it's, you know, people aren't used to moving in that way. And we're not used to the idea of like, you know, I could hit my knees on a corner of a concrete obstacle, or I could, you know, snap my shins in half or, you know, get a concussion or something. And so it's, it can be frightening to move into that realm of, you know, moving differently.",611,158
14,27,interviewer,"It's interesting, because you mentioned it felt, felt natural when you were learning it. But then you mentioned that other other students have found it difficult, or a bit more intimidating because it wasn't something that we're used to doing. Do you think it is like, a natural human movement? Or is it something we have to learn to do?",267,60
14,28,participant,"I think, you know, I've spent some time thinking about that, actually, just on my own, and I think it is a natural movement. And I would, I would even propose that every movement in Parkour is natural, right? That if you if you take a human being and you put them in whatever environment and you say, okay, move, right, get from A to B, and you don't tell them how, and they have to learn how to do it. I think I think it would be natural, and I think you would see the same movements, evolving and growing, you know, the same that the way that we've seen them evolve and grow in parkour. It's, I think, the the apprehension and the fear comes in, especially for newcomers, when you know, we live in a society where this sort of movement is, its people are not given the opportunities to, to discover it, right? Because it's a discoverable thing. It's not always something you need to teach. Because people don't know how to do it. They don't know how to do it, because they have not had the opportunities to do it themselves. If that makes any sort of sense, whatsoever.",823,204
14,29,interviewer,There's not a reason for someone to kind of naturally stumble over it in-,58,14
14,30,participant,Right.,5,1
14,31,interviewer,-kind of modern day to day life.,24,7
14,32,participant,"Yeah, you know, we're, you know, people are busy, you know, walking to work or taking escalators and, you know, children are told, ah you know, get down don't, you know, don't climb on that don't jump, you know, you'll get hurt. And it's, it's such a stark contrast for me, because I grew up in, you know, the northern backwoods of Vermont on a farm so I was climbing trees and walking over logs and jumping off everything that I could see, you know, and so there wasn't really that like, conceptual restriction on movement, you know, it wasn't just like, walk or sit down or climb in the appropriate areas, you know. And so, I mean, I remember finding some of these movements in parkour like that we see in parkour just on my own like, I found those movements. And I didn't know that it was part of a discipline that was, you know, larger than that. I thought it was just something that I was doing. That's, that's why I find it's definitely like, natural, you know?",735,181
14,33,interviewer,"What, what kind of uses would the Kong vault, lend itself to?",47,12
14,34,participant,"Hmm. Okay, so as far as I mean, traversal goes, I, pretty much anything, I would say. Particularly, it's good for clearing obstacles of a certain height. So if you need, like, if you have a lot of forward momentum, and you need to just direct that movement up on something that you're not going to, you know, run up or climb up otherwise, that's, it's good, I think, because you've got your hands up here, right, the upper segment of your body, so you can reach up, you know, kind of pull yourself up. Yes, and get over without losing too much. Yeah, too much momentum, also distance. So whether that's, you have an obstacle that is long that you need to travel over, so you can dive into a kong from one end or the other, right, closer end or the farther end? Or you can, I would say, if there's a gap between two obstacles, you know, that you for whatever reason, maybe the environment is set up such that you can't do a running jump, or the obstacles efficiently, like, hop up and run on done. You know, you kong from one over the gap to the other. So, kind of standard stuff, I think.",824,209
14,35,interviewer,"And say, compared to some of the other vaults that we might use in parkour how, does it, how does it compare to some of the more common ones in there, there, is it, I dunno, faster? I mean, you mentioned distance, is that like, a really standout feature of it?",198,51
14,36,participant,"I think it does, at least for me, I think of the kong as being a movement that's good for covering distance moreso than something like, like a dash vault, right? I think, you know, I feel like it would be harder to get the same amount of distance that you can get from a Kong vault out of a dash, right? Maybe because, like, if I had to break it down, I think, because the Kong is more, more immediate, maybe that's not the right word, but like your, the continuation of your energy is unbroken, right, you've got a run up your hands plant, and there's no break in that in that. Okay. [connection cuts out, on resumption] Yeah.",477,121
14,37,interviewer,Okay. Sorry about that.,18,4
14,38,participant,"No worries, it's okay.",16,4
14,39,interviewer,"I dunno kind of why, I don't know why Iit just decided to give up. So yeah, I'm sorry, that that cut off pretty much at the beginning of your answer to my last question. So if you don't mind repeating yourself, please.",166,43
14,40,participant,"So your question was, you know, does the does the kong vault lend itself to something like distance over other movements? I think essentially. Yeah, you know, the, I would say the kong vault lends itself towards distance in particular, over something like, like a dash vault or even a speed or like a step vault or something. Because the, how do I say this? I struggled with it in the other answer too. Um, the, the energy of you are, well really your your energy is unbroken, right? Where so for like, like a dash vault, right, you have to jump, and then the push is an afterthought. And so it's not really you're not generating much distance, right? You're not, you're not going very far. But with a kong, you've got, man, how do I phrase this? The trend, like the conversion of your, like your run up to the push on the obstacle. There's, there's almost no break between them. So it's, you have a continuous sort of transfer of that energy? I don't know. That's, maybe that's the best I could do. It feels very unclear to me. I wish I could answer that more eloquently.",819,200
14,41,interviewer,No it's good. But how about when it comes to like connecting it to other movements? Is it is it good for that? Is it or is it quite difficult?,108,30
14,42,participant,"Depends on how you do it. If you're, sorry about that, if you're if you're doing a kong for distance, or height, you know, you're probably not going to be able to link it very efficiently to other movements. If your goal is to like, you know, turn very quickly or, you know, go back or do something else. In general? I don't know, maybe I want to change my answer, because I was thinking, in general, it does kind of, you can do other movements into a kong very easily, you can do movements out of a kong very easily. There's a good combo that my friends and I like to do to Kong, directly into a step vault. You know, I've seen that. Like, I know, that's not a unique thing to do. But it's a good example of, you know, you can do a kong, and before you land like you're landing out of the Kong is another movement, or another vaults or, you know, a kong to an underbar or something. So, it's yeah, I would say it's versatile enough that it lends itself to transitioning between movements very well.",757,194
14,43,interviewer,"Does the, does the upper body play much of a role on the obstacle itself? Or is it all coming from that takeoff? In terms of-",96,26
14,44,participant,"Ooh. Good question. Yeah, it's such a debate. Well, it depends. I think it really all, like everything else in parkour, it depends on the context, right? What are you trying to do? What is your environment like? You know, what's, you know, are you are you comfortable with Kongs or not? I think, really, you can get your power. And like the man, how do I say this? The role of like your upper body in a Kong versus your lower body in a kong, right, or where you generate that power? It depends on who you are, I would say and what you're trying to achieve. So there was a period of time in my training, where I was generating power from my Kongs almost exclusively, from my lower body, through, you know, the, I would take off my left foot, and swing my right foot, up and back behind me, right, as hard as I could. And I would use that to generate the lift from my hips, and my hands were just there to guide me through. And then there have been times in my training, where I was not focusing on swinging the leg, and I was getting all of my power or most of it from the push, slash pull with the hands. I mean, ideally, I think, I mean, you can get power from both, and I wouldn't say that it's preferable for, to generate power from your upper body versus your lower body. And I wouldn't say that it's necessarily even one plays a larger role than the other. It's, which one, which one allows you to be most effective in your movement? Right. So for someone, maybe, you know, I train with some, some of the people I train with are women, right. And they tend to develop power in kongs through their lower bodies. Right. Whereas I think, like I said, I played around with it before, but I like to generate power with my upper body. So yeah, it depends. That's the short answer. It just depends.",1369,348
14,45,interviewer,"I guess maybe a better question might have been, can the upper body contribute to the movement?",77,17
14,46,participant,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's, you know, I think just just by virtue of the fact that your only points of contact are your hands, there has to be some involvement in the upper body. It's not for generating power, just to, you know, just to do the movement, which we've established is, you know, in some form or another relating to the placement of the hands on the obstacle.",280,69
14,47,interviewer,"And when you're kind of coming out, on the other side of the obstacle, is there a certain way you want to be like, exiting the movement as well? Or...",113,30
14,48,participant,"Yeah, let's, okay, let's assume you're on flat ground, you're not going to, like you're not intending to go into any other movements. You're just konging an obstacle. Land on your feet. [laugh] That's generally the best bet for beginners. Yeah, land on your feet. You can land in a precision, right with feet together, and stop. You can land on one foot and keep going. It's, I don't know. Like if you're if your question really is just, is there any, any way that you should want to be landing out of a Kong? Land on your feet. Everything... You know, details.",421,103
14,49,interviewer,Good advice.,10,2
14,50,participant,Yeah.,4,1
14,51,interviewer,"I guess, what I might be curious about is, you know, particularly when you're coaching what might you be looking for in terms of like, oh, that was a that was a good Kong vault or a bad Kong vault. Or I might like to improve this in a student or anything like that. You know, there are there certain things you like to look out for, or signs of quality or success?",281,73
14,52,participant,"Right, right. Yeah. Okay. A quick aside, before I answer that, I want to say I really appreciate your questions. You've got some fantastic questions here.",120,26
14,53,interviewer,Thank you.,8,2
14,54,participant,"Yeah, you're welcome. Yeah. So when I'm coaching, it's funny, just the last two weeks, I've been coaching a woman on Kong vaults specifically. And she's a total beginner, so pertinent right [laugh] So what I look out for, really, in general, is, first and foremost, are they are they approaching the movement properly? So are they you know, placing their hands in the correct way with their thumbs flat? Not, you know, not like this? Are they... You know, are they approaching with enough speed? Are they confident in their ability to actually go over the obstacle? You know, just just I think just because of the way that I like to coach people, I prefer to give not a lot of direction to the student, and then kind of refine the movements with them. So, you know, show the movement, explain, basically, okay, put your hands like this go through. And at that stage, what I'm looking for is just to work with, with the fear or the apprehension that might be there. So that's, that's the first thing that I look for, like progress for success in Kong vault is, are they able to like are they in the right mindset, to be able to approach the Kong and really work on the technique? Because if you're fearful, you're going to hold yourself back. Right? And that's not what you want for developing, you know, fast, strong approaches for the Kong vault were a long dive into the movement or anything like that. But apart from that... yeah, the feet, I think, how do I, uh, English. How do I say this? Maybe I maybe it's not that I look for certain things. Just that I note certain things, and that's kind of an intention, like, I will pay attention to, does the student prefer to take off from one foot or out of a punch. And I'll use that to sort of cue myself, to cue them properly. So if they already tend to want to dive into it out of one leg, then I'll focus with them on that technique, and developing a single leg take off. Or if they prefer to punch, then I'll develop the punch with them. But the most important things are just really confidence, I think, in the approach, proper hand placement, and then the exit really takes care of itself. I find I don't have to do that. People naturally figure out how to land out of movements properly. So is that kind of what you're looking for?",1759,429
14,55,interviewer,"Yeah, that's great. I'm aware as well, that, you know, there's always going to be, you know, individual, you work with individuals, you know, but I guess it's just kind of like, maybe things that come up regularly, or common things or stuff that you've just noticed, like, ah this is good to try and get across to someone when they're learning it. Right?",269,64
14,56,participant,"Yeah, yeah. Yeah. You know, it's for me, it's definitely, definitely all about like, the, the internal approach, right? Yeah. Are they apprehensive? How apprehensive? Are they what's causing that apprehension? You know, are they worried they're going to clip their feet? Or are they worried about, you know, something else? Like, you know, speed or power? Are they not sure how to place their hands? So, I don't know. I think that's that's kind of what I like to focus on mostly with the coaching.",379,86
14,57,interviewer,"Is that with the Kong vault, you think maybe, because there's a, quite high degree of like commitment to the movement, you know, you have to dive headfirst basically, and particularly when you start getting more powerful with it, like you mentioned.",199,42
14,58,participant,Yeah.,4,1
14,59,interviewer,It can be a little bit intimidating to people?,37,9
14,60,participant,"Oh, absolutely. Yeah. I mean, it's, you know, I think, especially for newer students, you know, even if they come from movement backgrounds. It might feel a little bit like asking someone to, you know, do a swan dive, a kong pre. Okay, just run and dive headfirst and, you know, just trust your body and what do you mean trust my body? You know, I don't know how to do this. So, yeah, I think it's, it can be probably one of the most intimidating movements. Now for some people, depending on, you know, their inclinations. But yeah.",402,99
14,61,interviewer,"So if, um, so, it's quite, you know, we've talked quite a bit about the Kong vault, kind of defining it a little bit. Not defining it, but you know, just talking about some of the details of it. I'm curious if that's, is that kind of reflective of what you learnt when you learnt the movement? Or has that evolved over time? Perhaps as you moved into coaching? Have you updated that in some way? Or is it pretty consistent with how you first learnt it?",346,87
14,62,participant,"Maybe I think, could you either repeat that or rephrase? I know, I'm just-",56,14
14,63,interviewer,"Yeah. Like, how you've come to understand the movement or how you teach it someone else? I guess, you know, do you coach it to other people the same way that you learned it, is one way to put it?",148,40
14,64,participant,"Right. Um. No, not really. I've, I've definitely, I think developed my own, you know, a way that I like to coach people that differs from the way that I learned things, in some regards, I mean, I learned very, very definitely, sort of, by way of just like, keeping up with people who are better than me right. It wasn't even a class structure. It was just like, okay, I met these people, they say, come train, you know, keep up word or leave, you know, basically, and, and I like to keep that sort of dynamic, that sort of mentality in my training, just to make sure that I have serious students, but for the Kong vault, I mean, I will, I will take some students through, you know, put your hands on the table, get your hips up tuck and whatnot. But apart from that, I mean, it's it's, I don't know, there's not like one way that I like to teach it. I like to let the student dictate how I teach, and not the other way around, right.",699,183
14,65,interviewer,"Do you- Sorry, carry on.",17,5
14,66,participant,"No, I just, I was commenting on on the broadness of the answer.",48,13
14,67,interviewer,"Do you, like, discuss anything about this, like with other coaches? Or do you have any resources you drawn for your coaching? In terms of teaching skills?",122,27
14,68,participant,"Yeah, yeah. And I, so I, train and coach and interact a lot with Sean, the guy that I learned from, my mentor, friend, whatever. So he and I have a lot of these discussions. There aren't any, like, as far as like books, or videos, or online articles, or anything that I don't really draw from many of those. Just because it's, there's nothing more to draw from, really. But yeah, I don't know. I mean, it's how do I say this, like the the discussions that I have with other coaches about, you know, how to teach the kong, or, you know, what are some common traps that students fall into? it? It's not, those discussions are not undertaken with the the intention of like refining our ability to coach, it's just there to talk about. Yeah, no, no.",561,141
14,69,interviewer,"Do you think that you know, something, something like that might be helpful to coaches, something that says, hey, here's a good way to teach the Kong vault, having some some guidelines and help out there for coaches?",171,38
14,70,participant,"Yeah, I think it certainly couldn't hurt. You know, I think if you're, if you're new to coaching, or even if you're experienced an experienced coach, but you're just looking to draw on other resources. If you're, you know, if you want to experiment with a new way of coaching, or maybe you've run into kind of a difficult point with, you know, teaching it to a certain group or a certain person, then yeah, I think that would be beneficial. I can't see any reason that it would be a negative thing, really, except, except if it attempts to sort of proclaim a proper way of teaching. And that's something that very sort of, I would be appalled at actually you know, if someone were to say, Okay, this is like the way to teach, and you cannot teach it any other way. This is the proper way. That's that goes against the entire spirit of parkour. Right, that goes against, you know, all of the all of the foundations of the discipline. So that would be very upsetting for me to see that, you know, yeah, I think just an opening. Here's some ways to teach it. Some ideas, some practices. Yeah, that would benefit everybody.",861,208
14,71,interviewer,"You, you preempted my next question, which was going to be exactly that, whether that clashes with the spirit of parkour for want of a better word, you know, like, Okay, cool. Um, I forgot what I was going to ask... We've actually covered an awful lot of the points I like to try and get to with people, which is, which is really good. It's, you've been very concise, which is good. I guess, really, I'm curious as well. Is there anything about the Kong vault that you might yourself be curious about? Or you feel that maybe you don't understand that you'd like to know more about?",444,109
14,72,participant,"I'll have to, I'll have to think about that. Just because I don't know. It's, it's funny, I feel like, there's not really a whole lot of like mystery or curiosity about the movement itself. For me. It's that curiosity lies more in the application of the movement. And I don't know, you know, how much of a line you want to draw between those two? But I mean, I guess the short answer is no, not really. I feel like it's, it's as natural as breathing to me at this point. And so that question feels a little bit like, you know, is there anything you're unclear about on your breathing, you know, anything unclear about anything, you're curious about the way that you, you know, eat food or drink water or something? So I'm like, Well, no, not really. But I'm curious about, you know, like, the types of foods that are out there. And, you know, it's kind of a weird analogy, but, yeah.",664,167
14,73,interviewer,I get what you mean.,15,5
14,74,participant,Yeah.,4,1
14,75,interviewer,"It's, you know, I think I said at the start, you know, I picked it because it's quite a well known movement. Do you consider it something that, you know, is important for people coming to parkour to learn? Is it like a staple movement?",180,45
14,76,participant,"It's, okay, it's a staple movement only because people think it's a staple movement. I would argue there, there is no such thing as a movement that, you know, people should learn, that is parkour. Right? I don't, I wouldn't even say that Parkour is like, you know, these movements, right. It's just movement period. So, no, right. It's, I would teach a Kong vault, to a student. And let them know, look, this is a very well known movement, if you haven't heard of it already. It's called this it's got this history or whatever. Really, only because that's been established. Right. But I don't hold any movements to be essential to the practice, right. Like it's none of them are the identity of parkour. Right. Parkour is the reason behind the movement. Right, and the application of the movement, that's parkour. Yeah.",624,144
14,77,interviewer,"What I find interesting is that, you know, a lot of people have that mindset. But there's still evolved, you know, parkour movements that you know, we've, we've given them names, and I said, kong vault and you know what I meant. So it's that weird clash between these things kind of have grown up as capital P parkour techniques-",255,60
14,78,participant,Yeah [laugh],9,2
14,79,interviewer,-In a sport that is very much about being free and open.,43,12
14,80,participant,"Yeah. Yeah, totally. You know, it's, it's interesting, because that's one thing I really, really tried to sort of instil in my students is an appreciation of, like, these movements, you can say that they sort of belong to parkour, but these movements themselves are not what Parkour is. You know, it's, it's like, learn the movement, learn the name, learn the history, but don't let that become everything that Parkour is.",326,72
14,81,interviewer,"Right. Do you find that- Sorry, carry on.",30,8
14,82,participant,"I was just gonna sort of add a little point about you know, just like learning to distinguish between like the the individual techniques, and really the the broader sort of, yeah, like the broader spirit of parkour, what it means to do, yeah.",192,44
14,83,interviewer,"Do you find that people come to the sport, you know, beginners or whatever, and they know what the Kong vault is? Is it kind of a little bit famous now?",117,31
14,84,participant,"Yeah, yeah. You know, it's, yeah, I know. So many of my students, especially young kids, right, like, you know, 10, 11, 12 year olds, they come to class, they're like, okay, you know, I know, all these movements. I know, the names. You know, I practised at home on my couch or whatever. And, and people think that they know, you know, what it is, and they think they know how to do it. And even if they've practised, it's like, okay, yeah, whatever. It's, I think that kind of, can hinder a lot of the real learning a lot of the deeper level learning that can take place with students who have no idea what Parkour is, they've never even heard the word. Right. Yeah, it's, it's, it's an interesting phenomenon, right? It's popular. And the image that parkour has now in the public mind, is so far from, you know, the, like, the original discipline, it's just totally, no, not even comparable. And, and so it's, you know, like, the number of students that I've had to sort of explain, like, Well, look, you know, you know, the whole, like, you know, flips in parkour or not, you know, and I'm not gonna comment on on that one way or the other right now, I think, but, yeah, it's, it makes it difficult to teach when people come with preconceived ideas of what they should be learning.",954,240
14,85,interviewer,"I'm curious, you know, if, with this kind of philosophy for it, you know, because, you know, generally, if you're going to teach something to someone, you kind of have to know what it is to pass it along. So, you know, taking the Kong vault as a really good example. It's such a broad collection of movements almost.",241,59
14,86,participant,Yeah.,4,1
14,87,interviewer,"...With some commonalities. Like, how do you think that's kind of come about, is that just kind of like, as a community, just people of over time, put these things together?",132,31
14,88,participant,"Yeah, you know, it's a good question. I don't know. I mean, you're, you're right, that, you know, you have to know what it is to teach it. And so, you know, if a student comes to me and says, Hey, I want to learn the Kong vault, and I say, ah there's no such thing. Kong vault is just a term, and we've got this, you know, a bunch of these movements that are kind of related. That's not going to do anybody any good. Right. So it's, yeah, it's, it's interesting to see how these things have evolved, though, like, you go from total, totally free sort of movement to, you know, movements with names to movements with specific attributes to, you know, combinations of movements, when before it would have just been, you know, no names, just, you know, just that progression.",577,145
14,89,interviewer,"I think... I think, you know, we've covered a lot here. Is there anything that's kind of popped into your head at any point, or you thought of that we didn't get to or anything you just like to add?",148,40
14,90,participant,"Okay, maybe, I don't know. I mean, I could talk forever and ever and ever and ever about, like, you know, like, you know, the spirit of parkour, the original discipline or why it's important to learn the history and stuff. But I feel like that might be a little beyond the scope of your, what you're talking about here.",244,60
14,91,interviewer,"Yeah, I'm trying to try to keep it to the Kong vault a little bit. Yeah. Yeah.",57,17
14,92,participant,"So no, nothing really. Okay. Cool.",25,6
14,93,interviewer,"Let me just do another quick check through all my questions in that case. Yeah, I think I think we're good.",83,21
14,94,participant,All right. Awesome.,15,3
14,95,interviewer,All right. I will I will just stop the recording and that case.,49,13
14,96,participant,All right.,8,2
16,1,interviewer,"Alright, so so the study is just really talking to parkour coaches about how they kind of understand some of the movements and how they've come to understand them, how they coach them to others, things like that. Bearing in mind that Parkour is kind of like this organically grown sport, it doesn't have like a central rulebook or, you know, group that's saying, Hey, this is what Parkour is. So it's just kind of seeing how, how these kind of different definitions of movements have kind of spread, and how people have come to understand them. And I just kind of picked the Kong vault as a particularly well known movement. But I guess the first thing to check with you is, do is the term Kong vault familiar to you? Is that the term you use, or do you use catpass, or anything else, or...?",618,147
16,2,participant,"I just say Kong. I'll say vault to beginners who have never done parkour before. And then I'll just say Kong around, you know, my team, or other practitioners that I meet up with. So what was that other word? You just said just now?",178,45
16,3,interviewer,"Oh, catpass?",9,2
16,4,participant,"Oh, catpass. Yeah, I forgot that was a term for it. That mostly covers like high gaps, right?",70,18
16,5,interviewer,"I mean, I use them pretty much interchangeably. Some people have told me that they have said they use them for different things. Or even like Kong, and monkey, as two different things.",146,33
16,6,participant,"Oh, wow. I forgot about monkey too.",26,7
16,7,interviewer,Yeah. Do you just use kind of Kong to cover all those things?,47,13
16,8,participant,"Yeah. And various labels. I just, I forgot that monkey was a was a term for the same move too. So that's always interesting. Is that more, do you find that like, depending on the country, or the exact community, specifically?",174,41
16,9,interviewer,"A bit of both? It's, it seems like it's a little bit more likely in some countries than others. So from my experience talking so far, it coaches from the US they seem to use Kong quite a bit. But it seems pretty, pretty random. And it just seems to be you know, like you say, the community that someone's learned parkour in just whatever words they happen to use, they might have picked up from they've watched a particular parkour video, or, you know, went to a particular class and it's just kind of what people are used to mostly.",414,101
16,10,participant,There's a lot of tutorials out there. Yeah. So.,35,9
16,11,interviewer,"Um, so I guess a good place to start is, how would you describe the Kong?",55,16
16,12,participant,"I would describe it... So some I've found that some people confuse it with the bear walk the natural movement beginners like PE class term bear walk. But I've noticed that the bear walk is you know, more tilting straight kneed. And more opposite limbs working together where whereas the Kong is more like hands, feet, hands, feet, hands feet with this rhythm to it. So yeah, I can see why it's also called monkey because you are moving around like a like an ape or chimpanzee. So that's how I describe it just moving on all four limbs.",419,99
16,13,interviewer,"Is that you know, when you think about comparing it to the bear crawl, do you mean on the floor?",74,20
16,14,participant,Yes.,3,1
16,15,interviewer,"And so that kind of hands feet movement... Is that used elsewhere as well? So like we talked about it being a vault a little bit as well, is it used on obstacles?",124,33
16,16,participant,When I'm specifically doing a kong on an obstacle?,40,9
16,17,interviewer,Yeah.,4,1
16,18,participant,"Yeah, if I if I feel like I'm going straight on toward an obstacle to vault or Kong it, I definitely emphasise when teaching QM and then Kongs like hands than feet. Because the timing between those two different parts of the upper and lower body are crucial for a safe, controlled landing that I've noticed when teaching people. Very occasionally I'll see like, the advanced parkour athletes, when they're maybe going across an obstacle that's more like a corner like two adjacent walls meeting, they'll kind of do this funny thing where they stagger the timing of both hands versus both at the same time. So I rarely see that. And that really depends on what they want to do and where they want to go. But that's advanced, if I taught that to beginners, it would just, I feel like confuse them with the mechanics of learning. Right? I'll put my phone away, keeps vibrating.",692,157
16,19,interviewer,"So what would you say, like, it's kind of difficult to say like a normal Kong, because obviously, there's a lot of variation you can do. But a usual thing is to have both hands at the same time?",148,39
16,20,participant,That's what I've actually noticed. Watching videos of all kinds of athletes of all levels.,72,15
16,21,interviewer,"I wonder if you could give me some more detail about using it as a vault, then like, what kind of things is it used on? Or, how would you kind of give a bit more detail about describing the movement?",154,41
16,22,participant,"Um, okay. Are you asking like, progressions? What the progressions would be, or...?",62,13
16,23,interviewer,"Yeah, I mean, we could talk about that. It's, as I say, the study is just kind of trying to understand how people know the movement. So if you are watching someone, and they did a movement, you go, Oh, yeah, they just did a Kong. How do you kind of know that that's what they did? Again, saying, like, you know, there's no rulebook for parkour. So just kind of how people have come to go, that is a column that is a dash that is a lazy,  right, that kind of what are the features of that? I mean, it's quite a broad question.",391,106
16,24,participant,"I was just waiting for you finish I didn't want to interrupt. So since you mentioned, like two different movements, let's just say, to tell the difference between a Kong and a dash, which are both clearing an obstacle in a similar way, Kong, you're leading with the hands touching first, then feet follow. Dash is similar, because you're still jumping over, but your feet lead. And then your hands fall like briefly, as briefly as you would upon. That's how I differentiate between the two moves.",390,87
16,25,interviewer,So the hands going first is kind of a defining feature of the Kong.,53,14
16,26,participant,"Yeah. Yeah, but the with a feet, I mean, with a dash, you're almost treating it like this, like super leaned back precision jump. That's how I see it with the dash. So you're almost simply jumping over the obstacle, you don't really have to like emphasise the hands, the hands are just there, to reassure that your body doesn't graze the wall. And it helps like transition, much smoother landing, because, do a dash but don't do it like perfectly and it will feel kind of kind of bumpy and weird like that, like being buffed. So that's how I see a dash and a kong.",433,107
16,27,interviewer,"How about, you know, if you're going to really break it down for someone, perhaps if you're coaching, are there particular ways that people would take off for the movement? Or land for the movement? How would you break those down?",181,41
16,28,participant,"I've a whole page, one page of my progressions, I cannot wait to share this. So for progressions for the Kong, definitely, definitely learn how to roll. Because if you come out of that badly, especially since you're going face first in a kong that could be nasty on your wrists, on your face, maybe awful belly flop or an awful like shoulder ram landing on your side. So obviously, I'm not gonna go into rolls because that's not what we're talking about. But learn rolls first in order to bail out of a Kong. And then when it comes to learning the Kong always starting on the ground with I'm sure what you've heard QMs or quadrupedal movement. Is that how you pronounce it? So with the QM, when I'm teaching kids because it's so hard for them to grasp because they want to frog hop, and that's more of an upward motion, and they're bouncing. Whereas this feels more like controlled stepping hands first, then feet. So what, um, I'll like use those floor ladder or ladders that you can just like, throw out on the floor in PE class, and that's a really good way to control and give them rhythm and a give them a target for every time they're placing down their hands and feet. And I just say okay, without jumping up, and without kicking behind you. I want you to show me flat fingers. And just hands, feet, hands, feet. I'll have their hands land in the next square and I'll let their feet land in the square behind. But realistically, and ideally, I try to get them to put hands and feet in the same square of each of the ladder. And but even before I teach that, I teach them stationarity QMs, which is a good warm up, not a lot of strain on the body. And it's teaching them balance and core and coordination, and timing. So like, so just imagine being stationary, and you're on your hands and knees, and you lift up one hand and then the opposite leg. And that just teaches them the difference between both sides of the body and the upper and the lower body. And then when I once I know they have control and coordination, then I teach them the coordination of hands and feet, hands and feet. But I don't always teach the stationary balancing because sometimes I just look at my kids, and I go, yeah, they'll, they'll get it, we'll just go right into their hands feet, hands feet. So I've noticed from a bunch of tutorials that I've seen in the past, people teach similarly, like the floor Kong were you doing the hands, feet, hands, feet, but your hips are higher, so your butt's higher, you're trying to extend out farther and farther, to do even give yourself an imaginary line or target to reach to to extend your QM or your floor Kong, whatever you want to call it. And the idea is to learn how to basically pull your feet to your hands, or how long or how far you can reach and how much faster you can do it. You can start with your butt low like my kids will start with their butts low and their hands landing right in front of their feet, just so that they're really understanding the full movement. And then I will encourage them to lift their hips high their butts high for so they can start bringing their chests up and keeping their chests up for the later stages of the Kong. I've noticed some people teach staggering donkey kicks on the floor with the Kong. Um, so same thing, but high, but you start kicking one foot out than the other. And then you can see how high you can kick for those like advanced double Kongs. And some people try to see if they can land a Kong from a handstand, which I thought was kind of cool. I don't know how many parkour athletes you follow on social media, if at all, but I just saw [name], I don't know his last name. But [name] in the parkour community, he's known for climbing and doing Ninja Warrior obstacle courses. He was able to do like a handstand on top of this high ledge, and then just just snap his feet down to the next ledge down below. And like he's full on like vertical handstand mode. That's scary. Amazing perfect technique right there. Some people have done it from a push up, see, they're gonna push up and then snap their feet and stand up. And it's all about seeing how far your feet can land ahead of your hands. So that is my step one out of, step three.",3285,806
16,29,interviewer,"Before you move on in that case, can I just ask you a couple of questions about that. I made a few notes about things. So that one of the early things you said was about getting the fingers flat? Is that something that you've seen, you know, people have a tendency to steeple the fingers or things like that, is it, it's important to get it flat?",268,68
16,30,participant,"For, on cement, I mean, when we're on the gym floor, it's not a big deal, but I try to break the habit right away. Because I'll see even adults like do the Tarzan knuckles. I'll see people lift their hands up and I'm like, you'll hurt your wrist. So I just try to get rid of the habit right away, though. You know, the kids want to be Tarzan. Sure.",258,71
16,31,interviewer,Is it like a safety thing? It's safer to be flat hand or is it a technique thing? Or both?,67,20
16,32,participant,"Oh, yeah. You don't want to people might just like suddenly put too much weight over maybe one shoulder or one hand and go. And I could just imagine like, eeh, that's them. Or, you know, just strain on the wrist. And I do try to start with warm ups. Like right away, like as we're jogging, I'll have a shake our wrist one of them up for, for kongs, because that's a lot, on your wrist.",288,77
16,33,interviewer,"Do kongs in general put strain through the wrist, do you think?",50,12
16,34,participant,"Yep, through the wrist and then like through the shoulders, if you've never done anything like that in your life, it will be sore. Even this day, like if I've gone a good month without having done a Kong or a good week. I'll be a little sore, I'll feel it in those areas.",206,54
16,35,interviewer,"And the the idea of kind of getting the feet up to the hands, or even past the hands. Is that... are they just, do the hands stay on the floor and the feet just come through? Or is there some kind of like lifting as well to create space as the knees come up to the chest? [overlap] I'm sorry.",220,61
16,36,participant,Repeat your question.,18,3
16,37,interviewer,"So I'm just curious with, you know, when you say you're getting the feet up to the hands, are the hands just staying on the floor? Or are you trying to push off or anything like that?",140,37
16,38,participant,"For so with the kids, because there's a lot for them to think about if you give them too many directions for something so complex. I just tell them like everyone just step, like treat the movement like stepping so stepping hand stepping feet stepping has nothing crazy, no kicking, no like boom, smack. But if we weren't further along than I would start emphasising the sliding or pulling. When I'm teaching the average teenager or 20 year old something person, I will start emphasising the sliding of hands because when I'm when I'm watching or doing the vault, the kong, there's a moment where it feels like you're slapping or it's like kind of like slamming your hands. But it's very brief, it immediately becomes a slide and then what feels like a pull.",600,135
16,39,interviewer,So the hands are pulling back to kind of throw yourself forward a a bit?,57,15
16,40,participant,Mmhmm.,5,1
16,41,interviewer,Okay.,4,1
16,42,participant,"Yeah. So great way to force your feet forward. And to, yes, yeah.",48,13
16,43,interviewer,Okay. All right. Cool. So what was the next progression?,43,10
16,44,participant,"Um, moving it to a low curb, sidewalk, or even those like parking things that cars park at in each space slot. So you just bring it to the curb, and I've noticed some people for the sake of control and slow practice, like they'll cup their feet, their thumbs around the curb, in case they need to like catch themselves. But as you keep practising Kong going on to the curb, I would keep thumbs away from the edge so you don't like jam them. Or end up slipping. It's kind, yeah, it's this weird like in between, like, you don't want to be too far out flat on the curb. You don't want to your heels, the heels of your palms being too close to the curb either. I mean, if you have great control, then it doesn't really matter. But just practising, either the staggered donkey kicks on to the curb, or maybe standing a few feet away and diving toward the curb. But the idea is to just bring it a little higher and higher each time. Yep, don't smash your, your toes or your shins or your face.",758,193
16,45,interviewer,Always pretty good advice. Yeah.,26,5
16,46,participant,That's pretty much it for that for step two.,34,9
16,47,interviewer,"Okay, so just adding a little bit of height to get up on top. Okay, what comes next, in that case?",73,21
16,48,participant,"Um, higher ledge, so about waist high. And I would practice, I would practice mounting it by craning it so just standing in front of it and using your hands to push up and get one foot on and practise that a few times and then I mean some people might be nervous and keep their hands down on the ledge but if they're confident enough, practice with the hands balance in front of you. And then um then maybe even like start practising with two feet, mount on it with two feet and then start backing up a bit and adding a more of a run toward it. I would never have anyone start like charging at it full on, we all have the beginners, a lot of freaking out or just slamming right into it. And then, when they do start mastering mounting with both feet on, I try to really emphasise knees in between the elbows, knees tucked to the chest. And they can start landing like a spider, Spider Man kind of way, like just kind of like they're crouching, kneeling, no, not kneeling, crouching, with your knees between your hands, hands on the ledge, and you're kind of leaning over. It'd be more ideal if this ledge was wider, so they're not afraid of falling over on down to the ground. But if they're confident, then it can be a little skinnier. And I find that slight shift in difference. And the width of the curb can really affect someone's mentality as they approach this. And then of course, you really want them to focus on the upward motion, and not leaning forward as much, but more on the upward motion. And then you just start practising, diving more toward it. And then the whole, like, how far can you get your feet past your hands, and they can, if it's a wider ledge, they can start practising konging, almost as if they're going to clear it without their feet touching, but their feet can still kind of like, land on the ledge. And then they hop off quickly on the other side. And then just keep landing their feet closer and closer to the other edge until they feel confident to clear it without feet touching. And then, very importantly, keeping that chest up, which is why I like to emphasise chest to the knees. No, that doesn't make sense, chest up because, chest up because you want to land out of it standing upright and running out of it. I still do this to this day, I'll still when I'm not really warmed up, Kong and lean over too much. And land funny, I won't fall or break my face, but it will just look so sloppy, because my chest is too forward. So just really emphasising keeping yourself safe. So you're landing in it in a nice, smooth run transitioning out of it. And then when it comes to like approaching it, because the approach really makes a difference in the success of the vault. Like first I'll have them standing in front of it. So they're not charging at it. And then when I feel like they're in control, clearing it, then I challenge them to start running lightly toward it. And vaulting and then I'll have them like really think about striding toward it. So that when they take off, they're only taking off a one foot instead of two, two makes the clearing of the obstacle kind of awkward. Stride really helps get a nice smooth arch. Some people will just habitually brake, you know, having jumped before the actual jump. And we all know how that looks",2569,619
16,49,interviewer,"A little hop, hop to two feet. And then go. Yeah.",35,11
16,50,participant,"Yeah, and it just ruins all that momentum that you're getting from that nice stride into the vault. So I really try to tell people stagger your launch do not jump off of two, it kills your momentum. And I kind of treat it like a plane going off, except planes can't dip, but like. So you're going straight up first and you adding this little dip and that's when your arms are going back for that hurl at that little dip so that it becomes this nice upward momentum. Some people just try to go straight and go, ee, that's just not consistent, doesn't feel good. You'll feel the difference once you understand that dip and apply it.",492,119
16,51,interviewer,So all these things are to kind of help keep the momentum from your run into the vault?,69,18
16,52,participant,"And just makes it even easier to not to not just do the vault and succeed but run out as smoothly or transition into some other move. And if they have already, if they already know how to do a precision jump, I try to tell them like land as if you were about to do a precision landing, like there's a curve on the inside and you got land perfectly. Chest up. Two feet on or one foot in case you want to, I don't know, step off that curve, something like that. And those are my progressions to a kong.",386,102
16,53,interviewer,"How, um. I really like that you've described it as like an an arc over the obstacle. And that idea of maintaining momentum. Is that like an important component of the vault to make it a successful, kong vault, to like keep a consistent momentum throughout?",203,46
16,54,participant,"I, personally, yeah, that's something I've noticed when I started learning how to kong. It took such a long time for me to learn it. And then someone one day said, Oh, just add this little dip. And I was like, Oh, that makes sense. Like, you're turning downward momentum into upward momentum, versus trying to, I don't know, trying to interrupt this nice flow. I don't know. I definitely noticed the difference when I was a beginner.",333,78
16,55,interviewer,"How, um, how did you learn the vault? Did you teach yourself or did you go to classes or anything like that?",83,22
16,56,participant,"Definitely learned it from someone. So I was in art school, in Florida. And by junior year, I, the our professor was like, here's your assignment, go experience something new, do an art project about it. And I always already, like, parkour. So I located very fast, a local Facebook group that does parkour. And I met up with their leader [name], who founded the [name]. And he let me take photo video references of him doing some wall runs, tic-tacs, whatever. And then when we finished, he was like, do you want to try? And I was like, Yes, I like, already had my shoes ready. I was hoping for him to ask that. So yeah, he taught me right there in that park. And, and then I went to some open gyms. And then I started taking private lessons from him. And then on Sundays, they would go to the beach, where there are all these picnic tables and trees, to practice all of our basic movement. So and then from there, I like, slowly start teaching myself. But it's always it's always like a combo of everything, your community, online tutorials, classes, private, tutoring, and self taught. So.",836,202
16,57,interviewer,Do you think you learnt in a way similar to the progressions you now used to teach others? Or is that something that you've come up with yourself since you've learned?,133,31
16,58,participant,"I think since I've learned, I've come up with, because I'm always just like looking stuff online. So I think I learned more from now online than I have from when I was with people. Because [name] has like, a nearly non existent parkour community. I have my small team here. And I'm not always training with them. So it's really hard to just be merely part of that community. To inspire you to push yourself, like, the past two years, I was like doing really well doing all these solo trainings, and meeting up with my team maybe once or twice a week. But currently, it's been kind of hard to get back into it. Also I am recovering from my obsession with snowboarding. I've been doing nothing but snowboarding so I've not parkoured at all. All winter. So I feel like that's really thrown me out of the game. And I'm just watching all my friends, all my my teammates, just like excelling. And I'm like, ah, snowboarding is so fun.",717,173
16,59,interviewer,"Well, you know, I suppose that's the thing. They might be excelling, but can they snowboard? That's the question.",87,19
16,60,participant,"Yes, they can! [laugh]",15,4
16,61,interviewer,Oh [laugh],7,2
16,62,participant,"One of them is our best one [name]. He can snowboard and do tricks and parkour like he is fire. But that's just him like, [unclear] can snowboard. But and he can parkour but he can't do though. Like [name] can.",156,41
16,63,interviewer,Right. So just to go back a tiny bit. You mentioned about learning from online stuff. Is that just watching videos of other people moving or is it like actual coaching resource stuff?,147,33
16,64,participant,"I just, just movements and you know everyone likes to throw their own tutorial videos out there so it can be just some dude I've never heard of. And I'll just watch it curiously, like, I'm always curious of how people teach parkour. And I think it's really fun. Because I can either be like, Wow, that's really a shitty way to teach it. Or I can be like, wow, that's I would love, I can't wait to like, try that and then teach it. Because it does seem helpful and slightly slightly different approach, or at least a missing component that that you can add to what you've already been teaching. So.",460,113
16,65,interviewer,"Is there anything like relating to the Kong vault that you particularly remember thinking, Oh, that was a really good tip, or whatever. You picked up somewhere? Or, I guess my question really is, have you have you seen some people teach the Kong vault in really different ways? Or does everyone kind of do it in a similar way with like, little differences?",283,64
16,66,participant,"I would say there is someone I watched, taught similar to everyone else. But then he added all these like tiny little missing components that was like, oh, like that just filled in the gap between these two existing progressions I've seen everyone else teach. That was cool. To add even more to what I know. I can't say I've watched a lot of Kong tutorials. Because the stubborn ego in me saying oh, you know that let's find a tutorial to something you haven't really, a weakness that you have not addressed in yourself in your parkour. So sometimes I find my mind wandering to other tutorials. So haven't seen enough kong tutorials a lot. I mean, but enough.",519,120
16,67,interviewer,"I'm curious as well, because you let me just double check. But I believe you said you... yeah, you have some coaching qualifications as well. Right? Yeah. From WFPF. Did they teach you anything about coaching the kong vault? Or was that, were those courses more about like, general coaching guidance, rather than like parkour specific skill coaching?",277,58
16,68,participant,A bit of both.,10,4
16,69,interviewer,Okay.,4,1
16,70,participant,"So I went, I forgot all about my certification. Like I've been doing this for long, I'm actually certified. I'm only certified in levels one and two. But I got certified years ago, at the [name] gymnastics gym. And yeah, I took an actual coaching class for a whole weekend. It was like non stop. It was like, from eight in the morning to like, four, like, maybe like a brief lunch break. But like, everyone was just so energetic, and so invested, like, time flew by so fast. And like, I mean, you were playing, and parkouring as you were learning, so Oh, I need to do that again. That was so fun. But yeah, they taught us progressions that I would never ever, ever thought of what I had started parkour, because I only had done it a little bit before I took that class. So it was a it was a big eye opener. And maybe it was a while ago, so I don't remember a lot of the content. I just remember being like, yeah, they know their shit.",709,183
16,71,interviewer,"But it didn't necessarily, you don't necessarily teach the Kong vault now, you know exactly how you learnt to teach it in that certification course. You still have your own... You don't remember?",153,33
16,72,participant,"It was so long ago. Like, 3, 4, 3 or 4 years ago? That's a long time [laugh]",51,18
16,73,interviewer,"Fair enough. Yeah. I'm just, as I say, because I'm curious about how people learn and then pass on the movements. Particularly with quite an open sport, like parkour you could be teaching anything, but we do have these kind of parkour movements, you know. I mean, I guess I should check that with you, dude. Do you consider the Kong vault like a parkour technique? Or is it just...?",294,70
16,74,participant,"Yeah, I would say so. I don't think I've seen, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, in fact, like, even people know little about parkour, but they know what it is simply from having seen glimpses of it on media. Like when I'm doing a kong out there, someone knows. Someone shouts you know, parkour outside and you're just like, yeah.",240,59
16,75,interviewer,"It's it's kind of a bit of a famous move right? Like, it's because it's it's just different enough that people can recognise it. Whereas if you're doing like a step vault, they might just be oh, they're just climbing over a fence [laugh] Like, it's, it's quite distinct.",203,49
16,76,participant,"I think you're right. It's a good point. Um... I was gonna say something to that. Yes, it's so funny. When you really think back to when parkour first became known. It was like, such a crazy move, like out of this world move to see. And now it's just like a basic. Like, that's how much parkour has evolved. It's crazy.",236,62
16,77,interviewer,"I'm just gonna, I was actually gonna ask about that, because you use the word basic to describe it earlier. Do you consider it like, a fundamental movement? Something that people should learn in parkour? Is it like, an important part of your parkour toolkit?",205,45
16,78,participant,"It's not necessary. Like you can still step vault. But it is efficient. So it's kind of beneficiary, beneficiary, it benefits you. Yeah.",105,23
16,79,interviewer,"Yeah, I mean, that's always the trouble isn't that there's always an option. You could always do something else. Is there, is there anything that maybe the Kong vault is particularly good for? Or like, unique, maybe in parkour? LIke you go, Oh, that's something that a Kong vault is really useful for?",233,53
16,80,participant,"Definitely the fastest way to drop down from something. If you're like, yeah, I'm not afraid of heights. I don't have time to like climb over this fence. Why not just Kong it to this big drop, and roll out of it? Like that is, probably the fastest way you get out there if you had to. Um, I think it'd be handy for high gaps, so I can picture someone, maybe trying to stand there and being like, yeah, I want to pre that. But that seems like I don't know. Maybe they'll be like, that's too high to pre. So maybe I'll just kong it. You know what I mean.",413,112
16,81,interviewer,"So like, kind of, if you were standing on top of something, it'd be quite a drop to jump down. But if you're just konging, if you doing a vault, you're not dropping quite as far, is that what you mean?",150,41
16,82,participant,"Oh, I meant, like, let's say the ledge is just like too high. So here's you. And here's the ledge, like you see, maybe like...",89,25
16,83,interviewer,"Oh, I see. So instead of jumping up onto it, you kong.",39,12
16,84,participant,"Okay. Yeah. You could kong to it and cat it, or you just run and plyo or stride. And then cat it. I don't know [unclear]",87,26
16,85,interviewer,"Yeah, it's, you know, it's fine to say that no, that it's there's always an option in parkour. It's one of the things I'm interested in what the study is, you know, we have these kind of techniques with names. The, if you're considering something like gymnastics, they're kind of defined because they have to be judged. You know, someone has to give them a score. We don't we don't have that. So, you know, what, what is being passed along in coaching? How do we define our movements in parkour? Which is a very big question. And that's kind of the reason why I'm asking a whole bunch of people about it. Just to see what their opinion is.",486,120
16,86,participant,What is their opinion? I'm kind of curious to hear what you've heard from other practitioners.,75,16
16,87,interviewer,"Well, I mean, I shouldn't really tell you, I don't want to like lead your answers. Okay. I'm curious. After I can, I can tell you that about what I've hard so far, sure. No problem. But I'd be curious what your kind of opinion on something like that might be.",193,51
16,88,participant,What was the question again?,23,5
16,89,interviewer,"Yeah, just kind of how we, how we know what the movements in parkour even are and how we pass those along. Considering people could just go Yeah, I don't really like kongs so I'm never going to do them again. And yet they've survived. You know?",188,47
16,90,participant,That's an interesting question. Yeah.,30,5
16,91,interviewer,"It's turned a little bit philosophical, which I didn't intend. But...",52,11
16,92,participant,"And like you said, parkour has evolved. So like a Kong can suddenly become a dive kong. You know, or are you going to do a corkscrew, a 360 or whatever like...",120,32
16,93,interviewer,"I mean, you said earlier, you know, it started out and it was like, Wow, look at that thing. And now it's something you might do in your first class, you know?",119,32
16,94,participant,"Absolutely, exactly. This is too philosophical [laugh]",44,7
16,95,interviewer,"It's okay. If if it's not something that an answer particularly springs to mind, it's no big deal. Just kind of seeing what people think. But it's curious to me that you have these progressions for a kong and quite, seems like quite a clear idea of what Kong is. But also, you said it's not necessarily so I'm like...",242,60
16,96,participant,"Or maybe it is, I don't know, because I, you know, I now that we're talking about it, like ideas are coming to my mind. And no, I think of how you know, it's to clear an obstacle, right without touching it really spending any time on it. But you don't have to run around it or under it. But then you think about moves like the speed vault. Speed vault clears it just as fast. I think with the speed vault, though, not everyone can speed vault over a very wide obstacle. Unless they Kong it, which is funny how that works, like a kong can clear an obstacle more than a speed vault. But then you see athletes like I don't know if you heard of [name]? I don't know if I'm pronouncing his name, right.",529,138
16,97,interviewer,"Yes, yeah. London? I believe so. Yeah.",27,7
16,98,participant,"Like he, he may have been the athlete, or one of the first athletes to, what's, maybe, is it the speed vault, or is it more of a step vault, like basically, being able to step vault or speed vault over three different obstacles consecutively. And it's crazy, because like, that's so unnecessary. But, you know, it looks like someone challenged themselves to me, like, let's like, push the most basic vault, the one that existed before the Kong, and see if we can carry it over all these obstacles, and they did it. Step vault over three or four walls just like slowly, like about at that length, or the height? Yeah, they're just like three walls in a row going a little lower and lower each time. And they maybe not as fast, but it was pretty fast. Never touched the ground. So. Food for thought.",614,148
16,99,interviewer,"I wonder if it's, you know, when you consider something like that, that's quite an advanced thing. That's not something that every everyone's going to be able to do. So maybe it's a case of like, the Kong lets people do that kind of stuff. But for like, you know, the majority of people. It's kind of not everyone's gonna be able to do that really advanced stuff with the speed vault or the step vault, but they might with a Kong vault. So it's like kind of serving a function that way. It's easier to do some of the things that are difficult to do with other vaults. I think that made sense [laugh]",460,115
16,100,participant,Wait are trying to say they couldn't have done that without learning this?,60,13
16,101,interviewer,"No, er. It doesn't matter. I mean, I guess the the real question is just, you know, what is the utility of the Kong? What, what what makes it something that people use if it's not strictly necessary? Why would someone choose to do it?",178,45
16,102,participant,"Maybe... Maybe it's just considered a very smooth transitional move to a different move. You know like Kong pre, kong cat hang, Kong climb up, Kong stride, like maybe it's just...",136,31
16,103,interviewer,Just gives you a bunch of options on the other side.,41,11
16,104,participant,"Yeah, Kong roll, kong drop. It's funny because like, it doesn't always have to be the first move to a string of movements. It could be like the last move. You could have like stride Kong or roll Kong or plyo kong.",163,42
16,105,interviewer,So maybe it's just quite easy to connect it with other movements.,52,12
16,106,participant,Yeah. That's where this conversation has gone.,37,7
16,107,interviewer,Can you think of any reason why that might be the case?,43,12
16,108,participant,Why it connects movements?,22,4
16,109,interviewer,"Yeah, why might it be easy to connect it to other movements?",47,12
16,110,participant,"It just is... just a movement. You know, it's funny how parkour movement lovers and philosophers would say Parkour is primitive natural movement. And yet, it's so hard for a majority of people to learn. And that's natural and instinctual. And that, but that just comes from being part of a modern society where we're sitting all the time. And we're like, relying on other equipment and other sports for entertainment. When parkour in itself can be really entertaining. If you know the basics to give yourself the the creativity and freedom to explore whatever available space you have around you. And that's hard. Some people, I may teach them these movements, but they don't know how to look at an environment and parkour out of it, you know, like, they don't know what to do with it. That's... So I think with the Kong, same thing. What is it? What will you make of it? How will you make it necessary and functional?",716,164
16,111,interviewer,"Yeah, I'm curious about that description of it as like a natural movement. But I think right at the start, you described how sometimes people can freak out when they're learning it. Is it, is it like a natural, instinctive movement for us? You know, it might be for monkeys and cats? You know, that we've named it for, but. Is it natural for us? Do you think? Or do we have to learn how to do it?",301,78
16,112,participant,"The kong, specifically, just that move in itself among all basic movement, ""basic"". Maybe it's not. Parkour in its essence, is natural. But the Kong? I'm glad you know, this. It's crazy. It's crazy. Like I when I first saw your message on that Facebook group, saying, like, I'm gonna study the kong. And I'm like, that's an interesting move of all moves to study. But now that we're talking about it, I'm like, you're right. There's a lot I'd like to know, that needs to be addressed.",360,88
16,113,interviewer,"I mean, you could do it for any movement. It's just, I think, you know, because that the Kong is that slightly famous one. And there's not a lot of scientific research into, into it, I was like, that's a good place to start. But you could apply it to any movement, like, what is it used for? How have we learnt it? How do we pass it along? Really, are kind of the three main things I'm interested in. And what's been interesting to talk to people about the Kong is, it does seem like a movement that has developed. That is like a parkour movement, like people teach it and learn it to do parkour with and not anything else. Whereas someone just running for a bus might do a step vault or without really knowing that it's a step vault. They're really unlikely to just do a kong spontaneously without being taught the movement.",639,157
16,114,participant,That's a good point.,15,4
16,115,interviewer,Would you agree?,13,3
16,116,participant,"Yeah, they do step vault or speed vault, or they just awkwardly hurdle it like track and field. All very good points. I don't know what else to extend on that.",123,31
16,117,interviewer,"Fair enough. I mean, I'm, you know, do you have any questions yourself about the movement? Is there anything that as a coach or as a practitioner, you're like, I don't know about this, or I don't know about that. Or that you're curious about?",183,45
16,118,participant,"Just how I could teach it better. So it's always like, enlightening to talk about parkour like this. Because you just end up thinking about things you don't think about before. Or someone shares with you something that was the missing link to your coaching, especially with kids because I mainly work with kids. Like I definitely would not be teaching kids Kongs as I'm teaching like four to seven year, or six months or seven year olds, and it's just too complex for them to understand like, they're coordinations already all over the place, it's too dangerous to teach them the Kong. But like, if the class was called, learn how to do the Kong, then maybe Yeah, but there's all these other moves, I had to like, teach them in an hour class, in a one hour class that I have to cover. And, you know, with kids, it's different, the aim is different. It's not so much teaching the skill as it is to keep their attention. So like, it would be cool to learn more ways on how to teach it better. So that it keeps their interests and and even with adults. Yeah.",820,198
16,119,interviewer,"I mean, it's curious to me because you have, you know, these progressions that you talked about, and you clearly think about the movement and coaching as you say about learning some things to teach it better. Do you think you need to be better at coaching? Is your method working? Do you find it works for people? If it works, do you need to change?",273,66
16,120,participant,"I wouldn't say change it, just keep adding to it. Because you know, sometimes with each individual, they don't need every single detailed step. You can just like move on to the next one. When you when you read their movement and go like oh, they're pretty self aware of their body. They have bodily kinesthetic intelligence. Yeah, I wouldn't say change. But it does help me that I should, now that I've said all this, I'd like I definitely need to practice the Kong a lot more now. Talking about this, I'm like, I really need to practice my Kongs, because I apply it quite a bit. And I can I'm like getting to that point where I can do a Kong pre but I can't do it consistently perfectly without fear. Like I always have to warm up to it. Like so to me in my mind. That is me. That's me trying to master it like I'm not a master at all of Kongs or parkour in general. When I have to keep warming up to it and like mentally prep myself like and then you see athletes out there who don't have to like prep at all but just say yeah, I'm just gonna do this.",806,210
16,121,interviewer,What is that fear that you feel for the movement? What do you have to warm up to?,62,18
16,122,participant,"I have to warm up mostly on... what I mean warm up, a bit of its mental, a bit of its physical for me, physical I have to warm up, on loosening up. I find my body tensing a lot when I'm doing a kong no matter how many years I've been doing Kongs and, and parkour in general, I tell myself if it feels easy and if you're looking at it and thinking easy, it will be easy. If you find yourself, your body tensing up. And the way your kong feel is heavy and not light you know that you could do better or that maybe you can improve your mindset and your prepping. So whenever I land a really beautiful Kong pre in the gym, it's because like, I was loosened up, I was mentally prepping myself and I warmed up to it, but also like, I don't know, I guess parkour really isn't that hard. And yet it is. Like, I can do a Kong. But I can't do it perfectly. So that's what's hard about it. But I found that, like I said, I'm like ranting all over the place, I found that when I do a perfect kong pre my mind was clear. And my body felt light, it didn't feel heavy mid flight. Mid flight is where I know whether or not I'm like, going to do something, right. You ever feel that feeling when you're doing a nice pre, especially the high one or a super far one? Like, you know, you've you know, something's up when it feels heavy. Like there's heaviness in your feet, your your torso, your mind, whatever. So, and then whatever. Like you, you got to make sure you land right you know, so there's the technique to that like prepping up to that to make sure the kong pre is safe.",1181,315
16,123,interviewer,"I wonder if that feeling is related back to that, like arc and the momentum stuff we were talking about earlier? Where if you get that nice and smooth, that's maybe when that feeling comes about.",155,36
16,124,participant,"Yeah, that's, that's a good connection there. Same with that same with just the basic Kong without any follow ups. Like, if I feel like I'm charging at it rather than dipping, I know there's a difference. Like, I know the difference. I know what's the right way and the wrong way, at least for me.",226,56
16,125,interviewer,"Is that more of a physical or mental thing? In your experience. Like, when you say warming up, you're warming up because you're worried about it or do you literally mean physically warming up, like for exercise?",167,37
16,126,participant,"Well it links, right? Like physical can't happen without mental but sometimes, sometimes you find yourself not thinking about it. And the physical is doing all the work. But that's I don't know. You know what I mean, yeah. And I don't know, maybe on a bad training day, you're just like, kind of like walking around staring around at things and you're like, not feeling it. And sometimes that's just all in the head. Or maybe it's the move, maybe you're like, Okay, today's not a day day for kongs. Today is a day of pres or just simple balance. I'd say 90% is mental.",431,106
16,127,interviewer,"Is the Kong like, how can I put this this... you know, just just made me think of this, when he said about some days, you know, you might not be feeling a certain technique. Is the Kong like, a little bit more of a challenging, vault compared to say, like a step vault, which is fairly kind of, kind of easy. You know, there's an element of effort required for a kong, I would say, do you think that's fair?",306,81
16,128,participant,"It's exhausting. I'm like, always kind of breathing a bit after, you know, drilling it a few times for a line or even... Yeah, there's always effort for sure. In the Kong versus the step vault.",145,36
16,129,interviewer,"I guess the thing you made me think of it is like, if I wasn't feeling great, for whatever reason, and I want to have just like a nice light training session, I'd go out and do step vaults, and maybe lazy vaults, no problem without thinking about it. But I probably wouldn't do Kong vault in like a light, gentle session. I don't know if you, is that, does that's like, is that something...",296,75
16,130,participant,Are you saying thats you personally or are you saying...?,44,10
16,131,interviewer,"Yeah, it's, it's, it's just what I kind of feel like I've noticed, and maybe I might have seen in some other people, if I kind of think about it, but I can't say for sure. I don't know, is that anything you would find? Or?",161,46
16,132,participant,"Definitely, I mean, if it's just a simple Kong, where there's like, not a drop behind it, or at least a big drop or like, a target behind it. I'll do it on a on a tired day. I probably wouldn't do with a lot of effort. You know, I mean, because I know, there's not the effort, because I know I'm tired. I know there may be risks of me hurting myself, because that's how athletes hurt themselves, they're either, they're either, they're, they're lazy, because they know they can do it. Because they've done 1000 times and they don't think about it. They're not like in the moment, and they're prone to injury, or it's the extreme opposite. They're doing something they've never done before. But they're pushing themselves and they get hurt. So that's how I see it. Like, if I'm tired, I'm not gonna be thinking about a lot even though I've done this move a million times, I'm gonna get hurt. I might as well just stay away from it.",699,175
16,133,interviewer,And I'm aware of the time we've been talking for about an hour now. I don't want to take up too much your day. And also I have to transcribe this so I try and keep them to about an hour so that I'm not transcribing the whole day. Is there anything else before we kind of wrap up that has popped in your head that we didn't get to or you want to just throw in at the end?,282,80
16,134,participant,"Just I guess a conclusive comment would be like I just wish there was more parkour in my area. More like outdoor or indoor Parkour gyms, and like a more supportive school curriculum for parkour, because like I hear places like in the UK have schools where the curriculum includes parkour, and have like parkour gyms attached to their schools. I think that's like was at Denver? No, not Denver. What am I talking about? Starts with a D from the UK and I'm totally blanking out. Um, yeah, just I don't know, maybe I have to move. Just wishing there is more, more passion for it. Because I'm not even just passionate. It's like, more curiosity. Because like, I can be parkouring and people around me witnessing it or like parkour, Oh, man, I've always wanted to try and I'll be like, Oh, you want to try? They'll be like, No, I don't like that it's definitely a niche for a reason, like, very handful of people who started with me actually continue training it. And I find that sad and beautiful about the sport. It's beautiful, because it is a gem in the sand kind of sport. But at the same time, it's like, only they could feel what I feel where I feel the need to train it daily. Instead of just trying at once and then being like Yeah, I'm good. And I see that a lot. And it's disheartening, especially among the female community. Currently, I am trying to start a woman warrior class with my ninja warrior friend. And we're both pretty much the only most athletic people I know. At least in that realm of niche sports. I know one other like parkour girl, but she does more flips and stuff. And she's good. She can like do backflips off of a tree, cartwheels, and all these other moves that I don't know the names to, because that's just not my thing. Like, people being Parkour is and it can be, but that's not what I think Parkour is, which is fine, they can be different. But she can't like do a simple precision, and she can't climb up on rooftops. So like, you know, I mean, like, it's just, it's really just trying to find a few females interested. But it never goes beyond that. It doesn't become a daily discipline for them.",1641,401
16,135,interviewer,"Do you have any, like thoughts on why that might be?",40,11
16,136,participant,"I did a woman survey. Like, I might post it again, just to see if I can get more participants by released it on my Instagram. And I asked questions like, I have it right here. Actually, if you don't mind me diving into this part of it.",179,48
16,137,interviewer,"Um, what I'm thinking is because the study is trying to keep it to the Kong vault. I might stop the recording. So I can do the transcription for what we've discussed so far. But then if you want to carry on talking, I'm more than happy to.",183,48
16,138,participant,I could summarise I guess.,21,5
16,139,interviewer,Yeah. Sure.,8,2
16,140,participant,"Instead of reading everything, um, a lot of woman I surprisingly found that it wasn't so much that they thought it was dangerous. It was that they thought that only strong, able bodied, beautiful woman could do it. And I was like, Oh, my God, that's sad. I mean, I expected that to be a reason but I didn't think I'd get that many votes on that specific reason. Another common one that shocked me, what was it, just not having enough resources, access to resources, whether it's online or a gym. A lot of them said that the the gyms they found were too far away or too expensive. Which sucks because that's what Vermont is, just everything is like a half an hour away, and we're not urban at all. So it's not like you're going for all this traffic. It's just long roads and countrysides. So those were the common themes of that survey.",645,157
16,141,interviewer,"Kind of sounds like the first one is kind of an image problem for the sport. It's, it kind of looks like something only elite athletes can do.",111,28
16,142,participant,"Exactly. And like it's like you had to remind these people like you do realise these athletes started just like you. They didn't know how to do this shit. They trained really hard, it's a discipline just like any other sport.",177,41
16,143,interviewer,"I suppose it's the problem with you know, all the all the people getting big on Instagram and YouTube and things is you're kind of seeing the end of the process. You see the the really good videos, which are amazing for people to put out but you know, it's like someone telling you I don't know. They like to run on the weekends and you go Oh cool, how many ultra marathons have you done? And it's like you're jumping right to the end. The more extreme versions, like no, I do all my training on the curb outside. That's something that we encounter over here quite a lot as well.",449,112
16,144,participant,"Yeah, social media is definitely, has everyone like social medias given everyone the tool to edit. So they edit whatever they think their audience wants to see. And our audience has low attention span, hence doom scrolling on social media. And so they think all they want to see is the the successful result. Which is why I respect a lot of athletes who posts their complete video, compilations of their endless fails all the fails, it's so it's like, I find more joy out of watching those fails than I do this, the cool videos and successful successful videos, because it's just that's what people need to see. Like, this is what Parkour is just failing, failing, failing, but learning how to fail successfully, meaning safely. So another common thing in the womens survey was, I didn't know the right progressions. Therefore, I was scared. Well, I can teach you the right progressions. If you come to my woman warrior class, so that you are confident and feel safe to train by yourself. Because training by yourself as scary and clueless as it can be, it can be a great way for you to be comfortable with yourself and learning at your pace. You're not pressured by people around you in class who may be a little better than you to push yourself, you know, so I could go on about this. Parkour in general. Yeah.",1036,237
16,145,interviewer,"Well, we've kind of hit all the main things I like to try and get through with people about the Kong vault. So unless there's anything else you want to add, I'll stop the recording. Yeah.",144,36
16,146,participant,"I was curious, actually, if you'd be okay with me, sending me this, so that I can share my social media and not like all of it just fill up parts like, are important for me to share to my viewers who may be interested in learning parkour or understand the culture of it.",210,54
16,147,interviewer,Do you mean the recording or the finished study?,39,9
16,148,participant,Both or maybe?,11,3
16,149,interviewer,"Yeah, so I have no problem sharing the recording. The only thing is I'd need to wait until I've submitted the thesis to release any kind of data from it, which would be in September, so it would just have to be after that. Yeah, it's a little way away. I'll stop the recording and we can keep talking.",231,59
17,1,interviewer,"There we go. So, yeah, so the study really is just looking at how kind of parkour coaches understand some of the movements that we do. And how they've kind of come to understand them how they describe some of the movements. Because you know, Parkour is kind of spread organically and kind of decentralised. And so I'm just really curious about how these things have kind of transmitted, and help people understand them, describe them, things like that. And I just picked the Kong vault as kind of like a really common movement that seemed like a lot of people would know. So I guess the first question really is, is the term Kong vault familiar to you? Is that the phrase that you use to describe it?",555,129
17,2,participant,"Yeah, so we generally use Kong vault in my area, I would say the only like, weird distinction we have is we call it a monkey when you don't go fully over. So if you're just getting like using it to get on top of something, we refer to it as a monkey vault. But Kong vault is generally what we call it. And especially like when you're going fully over an obstacle.",280,73
17,3,interviewer,"I've heard that kind of, is it just getting the feet up on top to kind of replace the hands?",70,20
17,4,participant,"Yeah, yep.",7,2
17,5,interviewer,That's monkey. I've heard that referred to as like a Kong up or a pop up as well?,60,18
17,6,participant,"Yeah. So we'll call we usually call them like monkey ups. So that's, like, we have the Kong vault. Sometimes it's referred to as the monkey vault. But generally amongst like, the coaches, at least we call it a Kong vault, with students, sometimes it's more of like monkey vault just because they're like, Kong doesn't mean anything to them. And we're like Kong, monkey, Monkey vault. When you're working with kids, slightly easier to explain, but.",345,77
17,7,interviewer,"Right. And how would you just kind of in very broad terms describe, describe the movement?",72,16
17,8,participant,"Yeah, um, so I would describe it as getting over an obstacle using your hands only. And you're continuing in a forward orientation, so you're not turning or twisting your body. And then as you're pushing past the obstacle, the feet are going between the hands. Exiting, you can either, of course, land, two feet, one foot, but ideally, if you're trying to add it into the route, keeping it smooth two foot takeoff, or sorry, the one two take off once you're landing.",360,84
17,9,interviewer,"Okay. I mean, you mentioned the takeoff and landing and things there. If you're going to kind of break it down into stages, almost, like are there common ways to take off, common ways to land? You started describing them but-",176,41
17,10,participant,"Um, there's lots of variations in terms of takeoff and landing. So we colloquial, colloquially referred to it as the punch takeoff when you're taking off with two feet. And then the one two take off when you're doing two, multiple steps. And that lets you swing your leg up for more height from the hips, and a smoother exit. And then of course, you can do your Kong pre landing with two feet in like that precision type of landing, or doing that one two exit to continue moving forward. Generally, when I'm teaching it, I don't necessarily start with the takeoffs and landings because when I break it down, I start with just working on getting the hips higher than the head, because that seems to be at least especially with kids, but generally with people, well, anyone who isn't already comfortable throwing themselves at things, the thing a lot of people get stuck on is the kind of head first motion and getting their hips above their head tends to be the thing that really, is difficult for people mentally.",804,183
17,11,interviewer,"Is it, is that just the mental side of it, or is it a physical challenge as well?",61,18
17,12,participant,".I think that depends on the person. It's a little bit of both, I would say it's definitely with kids a lot more mental, with adults, sometimes that is like a mobility issue. But it's also the coordination of trying to, you know, use your arms to get your hips because that's not a movement that we're necessarily used to using, especially as adults in our modern world, you don't really have many scenarios where you're trying to pop your hips up above your head. So that can kind of take some doing and working on just, you know, getting comfortable in that position on the floor like working almost like handstand hop up donkey kick type of things, just to get used to allowing them to rise. Because the mistake that you see very often is people like kicking their legs out and back. So their hips don't actually rise and their head stays up or if you're going over an obstacle that's lower people kind of frog hop over it and stay in the same orientation of like head to hips, and you're just like jumping over it, I'm like okay, you didn't exactly use your arms there so it's not going to translate when you've got a taller obstacle.",892,212
17,13,interviewer,"So just kind of tapping it with the hands as they go over, but really they're just box jumping it.",76,20
17,14,participant,"Touched it and then jump, well, yes you did use your hands, unfortunately that won't quite help you a little bit later on. ",95,23
17,15,interviewer,Is the something of take it to the hands should be doing in that case on the obstacle?,68,18
17,16,participant,"Yeah so with the hands working on the push, I like to do that on the floor because that's a little bit less scary and you tend to have to like work with that push or using like a really low like precision trainer type of obstacle to kind of start with the reach into the push and that's another one with doing the monkey ups or just getting your feet on top of the box is a really nice one for that because that kind of forces you to move your hands out of the way and really get that push. That one sometimes helps people with hips, sometimes not because some people have the mobility to just kind of like bring their legs up underneath them but I like that one to get the push, pushing with those hands because that's kind of you know one of the many pieces that you have to put together. You got to get the hips high enough so that they can go through the hands, hands need to push as the legs come back down.",719,184
17,17,interviewer,Is that push creating space for the legs to come through or is it pushing behind you to get you to go further? Or both?,93,25
17,18,participant,"It's a little bit of both, more the hips rising is more what's creating the space for the legs so the higher you can get the hips the more space you're giving yourself now, like I said some people just have the like hip mobility to tuck themselves up really tiny so they don't necessarily need the hips quite as much in some scenarios but that's kind of like then you're stuck with that so I like to try to teach really trying to raise those hips to give yourself space. The push is a little bit, I tend to think about that yes you need the push to help raise yourself but you also need that to come back to standing so you don't like Naruto run out of it.",514,131
17,19,interviewer,So that kind of helps you reorient yourself to upright.,45,10
17,20,participant,"Exactly. Yep, it's like in the lache, when you do the throw to set yourself back up this is the kind of the kong version of that if you will.",107,30
17,21,interviewer,"So just to come back to the takeoffs, you mentioned the punch and the split foot?",64,16
17,22,participant,Yeah.,4,1
17,23,interviewer,What kind of effect do they have? What's the difference between the two?,57,13
17,24,participant,"Yeah, um, so with the punch takeoff I think of that more as if I'm thinking in terms of like a parabola that's going to be a taller parabola so you might be able to get over something taller because you're just going more up and straight down. If you're trying to go for height and distance that's when the split foot becomes really helpful because you can kind of punch from each foot and then swing your leg up behind you to lift your hips a lot higher. So that's, the punches, you're just jumping your hips high enough but it kind of is like halts all of your momentum, the split foot is when you're carrying the momentum through that gives you a lot more distance and power but tends to be trickier to coordinate for a lot of people so that tends to be like, you learn the punch first to be able to get over and then okay now you've got that now let's talk about splitting your feet swinging your leg to do all of that. I should I guess also mention with the takeoff, we call it the dip when you're kind of like getting a little lower to take off so that push starts the motion with the legs so the push is kind of at the beginning throughout and at the end, but getting lower to the obstacle to give yourself more of a spring into it you can like bend your legs and bend your arms to get more power.",1023,259
17,25,interviewer,"So it's kind of like any other jump, you come down before you go up, to get more power.",65,19
17,26,participant,"Exactly. Yep. But that's a lot of, it's tricky because sometimes you're so focused on getting over it that you don't necessarily think about like you come at it and you're already trying to rise you need to dip into it in order to get over it.",188,47
17,27,interviewer,Does that affect the parabola that you describe? The arc over the obstacle?,61,13
17,28,participant,"Yeah it's kind of the way to I guess, without, the dip is more of a split foot thing so that gives you kind of the power you would get with the punch while still getting the split foot because you're coming down and rather than going you know a wider arc, you're coming down to come up and over, and then you can get more push to get further. So it's kind of, I guess it wouldn't be a parabola, I don't know the math term for an uneven parabola, but [laugh] you get the idea.",362,97
17,29,interviewer,"And so what, what kind of obstacles is it used on? Obviously, I know that there's going to be a huge amount that you could potentially be used on. But are there the general types of things that people go ah, that's, that's good for konging? I'm probably, that's a terrible question [laugh]",222,53
17,30,participant,"[laugh] I, I see what you're saying.",25,7
17,31,interviewer,"I mean, in terms of things like height and width and stuff, not you know, oh, this block or that block, like, general characteristics.",104,24
17,32,participant,"Right. Um, I mean, it tends to be like vaultsable wall type stuff, although that's why I think like, practising actually the Kong up or monkey up is really good, because then that gives you a little bit more variance of what you can use with it, but I also really like ground Kongs, and like, just using that motion on the ground, but the typical thing is, you know, you know, like hip, to waist height wall, going up and over. I mean, depending on your skill level, I look at something chest height and go hmm, probably not gonna be able to get over that very easily with a Kong. But for some people, that's like, cool, no issue, could do that. I do think really short Kongs can be fun, because you kind of have to change your technique. But that's not like a typical use. That's more just quirky, just playing around.",630,156
17,33,interviewer,"I mean, short as in height, like, low down.",31,9
17,34,participant,"Yeah, like the lower to the ground, because you have to kind of change your technique a bit and working distances, that is interesting, because you're not able to get that kind of dip in your takeoff. So in some ways, it can be harder than some of the like more standardised ones. But that tends to be like I said, that's not a typical use. That's like, just messing around playing with different ideas. But like I said, I think it can be a lot more versatile than we think about it very often because you got your monkey ups, your ground Kongs, like using it in lots of different situations, not just over a wall. And of course, then precisions as well, adding on to the end of it. So.",532,132
17,35,interviewer,"So in terms of landing, you're trying to land on something on the other side?",60,15
17,36,participant,"Exactly. So it's not just getting over and continuing moving but trying to Kong over and then land and stay there and stick that landing on something precise. Whether that's a curb, just the ground or a railing or something you know. And then of course, pushing that further, you can do kong cats, Kong, Kong into plenty of different variations of things.",282,63
17,37,interviewer,Is that something that's useful about the Kong compared to maybe some other vaults? That you can connect it to a lot of other stuff?,105,25
17,38,participant,"Yeah, or in an in a different way, I think it's a little bit easier, in some ways to precision, like jump and land out of it, just because your body stays in that forward orientation, rather than having to like turn or twist or reset yourself. And same with the going into a cat leap. When you're, you know, aiming for a wall and trying to catch on to it. You're already in that forward orientation. So you don't have to work with any kind of twists. Like if you're trying to do one of the other coaches at the gym, I work I was messing around with reverse vaults to cats where you're completely twisting your body. And now you're dealing with forces pushing you sideways while you're trying to catch on to a wall that's forward, which makes that much, much more difficult. The Kong is nice, because you're already heading in that direction. Everything is set up the way you needed to be. You just need to get your feet out in front of you which the Kong vault works well for when done correctly.",776,189
17,39,interviewer,"Yeah, I like that. So that kind of always staying in that almost linear motion, straightforward. How about in comparison then to like a dash vault? Because that's similar that you're going very forwards. Is there a difference?",180,38
17,40,participant,"Yeah, so the dash vault instead of... the Kong vault is all about hands first. And that was kind of one of for me, the tricky parts of learning it was I felt like I had to dive into it. You have that diving motion. And depending on what you're trying to do, your feet need to leave the ground before your hands are on the box. Dash vault is pretty much you're jumping over it. So your feet are going first and then your hands are pushing off behind you. So you still have that same type of orientation. It's just, and like the push all that stuff. You need all the same pieces. It's just a different order, if you will, as opposed to hand starting first, your feet are going first. Otherwise, they're kind of pretty similar. It's like the I'm facing upwards towards the ceiling or facing downwards towards the floor.",632,155
17,41,interviewer,"And how about in terms of things like that getting to a precision or something like you mentioned. Is it, because the Kong just lets you get more distance or something like that?",143,33
17,42,participant,"Yeah, I think with the Kong vault just because of how it's set up, at least for most people, you can produce a lot more power. Because it's easier to push, where you're struggling, you get the full push from hands in front of you, two hands behind you, and bring those feet through, getting a lot more distance. Whereas the dash vault, it's kind of limited by how far you can jump because you're essentially jumping over it and you do get a push, but you get a lot less of a push, you've got so much less range of motion when you're starting the push behind you. And you can only go as far as your arms extend behind as opposed to starting in front. And doing the entire way through the dash vault is like the last half or a third of the push that you're going to get from a Kong vault. So you can apply it to similar situations, but I don't think it's your, you're going to be able to get as much power. So if you're going for distance kong vault, it's going to be your better bet.",754,195
17,43,interviewer,"So one of the things I'm really curious about is you know, you've mentioned there's a couple of different takeoffs, different ways you can land come out of it. There's, you know, other things kind of within the Kong family movements, like I've heard some people describe, like, diving Kongs and double Kongs. Yeah. What is it that kind of makes something a Kong? I know it's a bit of an abstract question. But if there's all these things you can change in it, what are the things that have to stay the same to be able to go, yeah, that's a kong.",419,103
17,44,participant,"That's a good question. Um, I guess I think about it as the hands are like... the orientation staying the same. So you're still continuing in that forward movement. And you're not adding in any twists or anything necessarily, the hands are still reaching out in front, you're getting the full push, and the feet are still coming through the hands. So you're still getting a jump. So when you're doing like a dive kong or a level Kong, you're still your body's gonna stay in that same orientation, you're just applying it to different obstacles and scenarios. So the movement remains the same. It's just the environment in which you're doing it is different. So with like a double Kong, now, you're just doing it twice before your feet hit the ground. But otherwise, the mechanics of the movement are staying the same, your hands are still leading, your hips still need to get height, arguably higher for a double Kong, your feet are still coming through, you're still landing on your feet. I guess you could argue like Kong to roll or Kong to flip or something. But even with those, you're still going to have like hands leading feet staying within that orientation, they're not going out to the side or anything like that. So I think it's mostly just the orientation and like the movement itself staying the same, and applying it to various situations.",1066,239
17,45,interviewer,Is it the kind of movement pattern over the obstacle itself-,49,11
17,46,participant,Exactly.,7,1
17,47,interviewer,"- thatkind of middle, middle portion almost.",35,6
17,48,participant,"Yeah, mechanically, like what you're doing is the same, you're not changing, you know where your feet are going, or whether your feet or hands are going first, based on the obstacle you're doing, you're taking, okay, you're doing hands, hips rise, feet through, landing, or continuing running or staying put. But all of like that is the same as to how I apply it to this obstacle, whether it's like a height thing, or I'm diving across a gap. Or, you know, going into a flip afterwards, that section of the movement remains the same.",410,96
17,49,interviewer,"Do you think that's quite a natural movement, or something we have to learn, or?",62,15
17,50,participant,"Interestingly, I think I think it depends on the person and kind of your movement history. Because some people have no issue at all learning it. And some people like myself, it took me several years to kind of get used to that, because I really had a problem with like diving for it and popping my hips high enough and trusting like my push would be enough. So I think it kind of depends on your personal movement experience, if you are not comfortable doing any kind of like headfirst type of thing. Or, if you just are like returning to movement and having done a lot of movement, that can be kind of tricky. But then there's like the people who have done all kinds of sports and stuff that tend to have less of a problem with it. And some of that I think is just having the correct amount of body awareness because it does take a lot of coordination and you really have to like know your timing, especially when you're working with like the split foot and exiting and all of that. And there is a certain amount of body confidence, because you need the momentum. Particularly, I'm pretty short, I'm about five, five feet one inch. So when I'm going over something that's a little bit taller, like I really need to have that momentum, and you have to have the confidence to be able to run at something and make sure you can get over it. And you know, people have visions of clipping their feet. And you know, the all of the classic Kong bails are just not quite getting there. And then having to deal with, now my head is the thing aiming towards the ground.",1229,296
17,51,interviewer,"Yeah, I think you mentioned earlier that kind of inversion aspect of it, getting the hips up.",74,17
17,52,participant,"Yep, exactly.",10,2
17,53,interviewer,"Is it tonight, learning to trust your arms as much as your feet a little bit as well?",66,18
17,54,participant,"I think it's definitely that. And I think it's partly just getting comfortable inverting, whether that's like handstands rolls, flips. Any kind of rotation, if you're not used to that, I think takes a lot of getting used to because that's not necessarily in the standardised movement vocabulary that most humans do. It's like running cool, walking, cool. But that's all in an upright orientation, when you're changing that orientation and asking people to either go like headfirst or to rotate, or, you know, go upside down, that's a lot trickier for people even just like hanging upside down on a railing from their knees or like hanging across their waist, can be really tricky for people because that feeling of falling. That has a lot to do with just getting a certain amount of trust that you're not just going to fall and having getting your hips high enough, you often feel like you're going to fall. So definitely trusting the arms, but just trusting your body in different positions and getting used to that in order to build the trust. So just finding, getting comfortable, if you will.",872,190
17,55,interviewer,"Yeah, that there's definitely a degree of like, I mean, you mentioned momentum earlier, there's there's some commitment you have to really go in to the movement with. Because once you've once you've dived, you can't really, really change your mind, right?",199,42
17,56,participant,"There's a couple aspects, I think are really mental about the Kong because like I said, there is the mental aspect of like, it's not necessarily a way that we orient our bodies. Normally, you have to get comfortable with allowing your hips to get higher than your head. Depending on your level of comfort, comfort with diving. Like I said, I had a really like difficult mental struggle with that, allowing my hips to get high enough because I was head first and the fear of falling. And then of course, the problem is, you're more likely to fall when you have less commitment, and less momentum. And when you do something weird at the last second because you go wait, wait, wait, I changed my mind, I don't want to do this. That's when you're more likely to get hurt. So that commitment is huge and extremely mental because you have all these other aspects that you're thinking about, not to mention, like, you know, coordinating the physical aspects to get the timing right to actually make it up and over. I feel like there's a certain amount of baggage that can come with that when especially teaching it to adults who haven't necessarily done movements like that in a while. That's one that a lot of people kind of tend to struggle with.",978,226
17,57,interviewer,"You mentioned you know, your own experience learning it a little bit. Where, where did you learn it? Did you teach yourself? Do you go to classes?",114,27
17,58,participant,"Some of both. I started out, training in like unofficial classes with, it happened to be with a bunch of people who also coached so I wasn't like totally on my own having no idea what I was doing. But it wasn't a specific taught class. It was a bunch of people who were training. So at the point when I started learning Kongs, I was, I had started then going to actual classes, but did a lot of training outside of classes as well. So it's some of both and a lot of my friends at that point were coaches. So I'd be like, Okay, can you look at this and tell me what I need to do and trying to figure out how to work out this split foot, it took me a long time I got the punch first, and then spent a long time trying to figure out how to split my feet on the takeoff and the exit to kind of smooth it out and get a little better and you know, give myself more range of what I could get overtop of and that was really working on building the momentum and coordinating how the legs work. So working on drilling a lot of things sometimes in class and then coming in or doing my own stuff outside of class either at open gym or at you know, outdoor training sessions and just spent a lot of time drilling things repetitiously [laugh]",957,248
17,59,interviewer,"Is that kind of how you, what got you through to learning it, just just keep drilling and drilling it, or was there any particular tips or tips or tricks that you picked up that kind of unlocked it for you?",162,41
17,60,participant,Let's see. I don't have like a eureka moment with the kong vault specifically. Learning the dip definitely helped but I had to learn the split foot first so I spent quite a long time actually trying to get the split foot worked out and I think one drill that really kind of helped me was ignoring the rest of actually getting over the box just trying to work on only the section of running up to the box and jumping and trying to split my feet and swing one leg so just drilling like only that section and not worrying about trying to do any of the rest of breaking it into kind of little pieces I think that was the thing that eventually got me to get that piece and then once I kind of had enough confidence during that being able to take it over the top. I do remember there was one moment with learning the exit where someone said to me because I kept landing with both feet kind of out in front so someone said to me at one point like kind of stick your foot back so I don't necessarily think about landing as hitting and running forward it's as I'm going one leg is going back down towards the floor and that's the first foot that hits and that lets it be one that one two kind of split foot exit. So I remember that was a really key piece for me was learning to kind of like rather than try to run forward stick one leg back to set up my split if you will.,1079,274
17,61,interviewer,"Was that kind of breaking the, the kind of habit of a precision landing almost where you have the feet out in front of you?",97,25
17,62,participant,Yeah.,4,1
17,63,interviewer,Getting them more underneath you?,28,5
17,64,participant,"Yeah and just like allowing them to separate too, like okay, just just take one leg stick it behind you as you're starting to land and then I was like oh, that was apparently the the cue I needed to really be like okay now I understand how this works.",197,50
17,65,interviewer,Mm. And now do like the movement? Is it is it one you enjoy doing or do you still find it challenging in some way?,87,25
17,66,participant,"Uh, I mean it's definitely still challenging but it no longer is like just getting over something challenging, I feel pretty confident at various heights so now it's working on, my current struggle is trying to get level kong pres, where I'm going over something and then landing on something the same height because for whatever reason they freak me out a lot [laugh] Shinned myself multiple times trying to practice it but I think just for that one I need to work on getting my hips higher than I normally would so that's the current struggle but that's the nice thing like we said about the variability of kongs is there's always like a next step or level you can work towards so once you get over and you're confident with that now you can work on kong precisions or kong cats or you know splitting your feet if you're still working on like the punch and land so there's tonnes of variations so I'm a lot more confident with just using it in general though I just, tend to still need to like if if I'm getting too close to an obstacle and I haven't planned what i'm doing I probably won't do a kong, I'm more likely to do something that's a little bit like, I need to still have some run up especially depending on the height of the obstacle so that's another thing I kind of want to work on is like my standing kongs have a limit in terms of height. Working on producing a little bit more power to vary the height that I can work that up.",1141,275
17,67,interviewer,"I'm really curious about what you said about it, needing to plan it a little bit to use it, so it's not quite an instinctive move yet?",103,27
17,68,participant,"It depends... I think it depends on what angle I'm coming in, like if I know I have enough space then I'm like yes I'm going to do a kong but I need to know like I need to have enough space so I can do like my one two split if I'm, if I haven't thought about it enough or I'm coming in at a weird angle I'm going to be like I'm just going to do whatever, like fall back to doing some kind of step vault or lazy vault to get over because that's like when I'm closer to the obstacle I'm like okay that's the easier version to do. Especially I think with kongs because you have that diving motion like you need a little bit more space than some of the others like with lazy vaults same with like dash vaults I still need I still feel like I need a little bit more run up because you have to take off a little bit sooner whereas a lazy vault or thief vault or step vault you can be right beside the obstacle. So just in terms of like the practicality of the movement, if I don't have enough space, that's not going to be my go to because my standing ones, like I said, there's there's a height limit [laugh]",848,226
17,69,interviewer,"Is that a little bit of like, power generation required as well? You know, you need that little bit of... because what I initially think of is obviously, some people can seemingly do magical Kongs out of nowhere from standing still, is that just they're somehow able to generate the power?",229,51
17,70,participant,"Yeah, I think that's a lot of depending on what you've trained or worked on. I know, one of my weaknesses is power generation, in all movements. I love like, flow and that kind of thing but I don't naturally and I haven't done a sport in my life that really requires a lot of like the fast twitch muscle. So that's something that I struggle with a lot more, whether it's like jumps or vaults, or anything, really, it's like when there is a need for a lot of power, I have a harder time with that. Whereas I have a friend who like did track in school. So he's got like ridiculous amounts of power and can jump ridiculously far and can do stupid things from standing. And I'm like, but that's, you know, based on his life experience and the things that he's done. He's really developed that and I haven't put in the time to really develop my fast twitch to a point that I can do some of that stuff. I mean, it's definitely better than it was. But I haven't specifically worked on that, and I don't naturally genetically have really strong or great fast twitch. So it ends up being like, okay, is that the thing I want to put the time into? Or do I want to practice like level Kong pres? Balancing act, you know [laugh]",935,235
17,71,interviewer,"So as you, as you started to move into coaching, did you, did you have to like update your approach to the movement in any way in terms of teaching it? Did you, or are you teaching it essentially the same way you taught it? How's it kind of evolved over time?",200,52
17,72,participant,"Yeah, I don't necessarily teach it the same way that I learned it. But that's also partly because the way that I learned is just like very repetitiously doing things. And I, most of the coaching I do is with kids, and when you just very repetitiously do things, they get bored. So there's a certain amount of like, you know, I was a little older when I started. And I was very invested in like, I'm going to do this until I can get it. Sometimes it's a good approach, not always, but um, I find with kids breaking it down into the individual pieces and getting them to work on the pieces and then slowly starting to put the pieces together works really well. And the other thing that I really feel is helpful... When you're working with adults who have a certain level of body awareness, you can give verbal cues of like, okay, you need to jump your hips higher and here's a way that you can do that. When you're working with kids, depending on the age, that doesn't mean anything to them, like they hear what you're saying. And they can't translate that into actually doing it. So something I like to use a lot, I use pool noodles a lot when I'm coaching kids at the gym, because that's a really low consequence way to kind of give them a physical cue of, okay, you need to get your feet like when you're jumping and pushing with your hands, your feet need to get over this noodle, or you're trying to jump and bop this noodle with your butt when you get your hips high enough. So they have that physical feedback, so they understand what it feels like. And I found that's a lot more effective with coaching kids. And I don't know, I didn't learn that way specifically, but maybe that would have been helpful for me as well. But giving that like physical visual feedback is really useful rather than just if you will, the the verbal feedback and being able to have them feel what it should feel like. You're like, okay, that's like, now I know what it should feel like so I can tell when I'm doing it wrong. And that's starting to build the body awareness for them.",1605,392
17,73,interviewer,"And has, that kind of those adaptations come about just from experience and you kind of thinking about it or do you as a coaching group that you're working with, do you guys talk about this stuff together?",164,38
17,74,participant,"Oh, yeah, we definitely discuss things. We jokingly kind of are like, Oh, I found the thing that works! The thing is, nothing works for everybody. So you're constantly trying to like update, like okay, I tried this thing. And that worked for one or two people but not everybody or I tried this thing, it was a total flop but I think if I switch these things that it'll work so we discuss it and it's one of those you're just like okay, I'm looking at the situation and what most of the students need and going what is the next piece that I can do that's going to help them lift their hips higher and just slowly building the experience to be able to see what the next step that they need to get to start progressing and I think that's just comes from experience after a certain point of saying okay I didn't plan out specifically all the pieces I'm going to do because I want to see what we need to do and address that specifically.",730,180
17,75,interviewer,"Are there are there still like common... you know, you mentioned, yeah you coach the individual, are there like common coaching cues I guess that you give to people with the kong, are there like common ways that seem to work for most people?",190,44
17,76,participant,"Um, I like to use... I like to start with kind of ground kongs to start working on the push the trick with that being the leap frog of course and trying to like stamp out the leap frog but working with doing the monkey up first and talking about pushing and trying to replace the hands with the feet is one that works well for a lot of people. I also like to almost do like a little not handstand work but working on the donkey kick and hopping the hips higher to get that feeling in people's bodies, start with floor and then move that up to kind of boxes and when you can get people to realise that it's not kicking your feet outwards but trying to pop your feet upwards that can make a world of difference but that one, that one's like 50-50 depending on the age and coordination level of the people you're working with but I do very much like the popping the feet up to the box because then from there you can kind of work on popping over and pushing with the hands. Another one I like instead of going over a box or wall that's thinner is trying to work on something that's a little bit wider and pop your feet as far as you can because that really works the push and that works well for most people once they can get their feet on top of the box and then get the feeling of the push they'll start to like really get that and doing that before they have to worry about getting over I think helps a lot because then you're less concerned about what your feet are doing because you can see oh I'm getting them pretty far, further than what the width of this little box or wall is now that I can get over.",1268,321
17,77,interviewer,"So its kind of finding ways to teach people that, the movement pattern without that fear element of, I'm gonna fall on my face.",100,24
17,78,participant,"Exactly it's, I think I like to progress the physical first because that then gives you the confidence to overcome the mental, tends to be like my way of doing it. I don't personally do well with like oh just go for it so I try to kind of progress people to gain confidence with their physical movements, be like yeah your body knows what to do now you just like you've proved to yourself that you can do it and now you just have to like okay I already know like the knowledge is there my body knows what to do the muscle memories there, so when I do it I should be okay, being able to kind of talk yourself into it tends to my approach. Which for the people like that I work with in terms of like, kids and like adult beginners are usually kind of my demographics, that tends to work pretty well. And like you always have like the one or two people who can look at you, see you do it and just do it, like wow you're a very strong visual learner of how the body works to like understand how to translate that but you're kind of teaching to the different types of learners, you've got the people who need the kinetic feeling of learning it, the people who need to hear you say that one thing that's going to make it click, and people will just look at you do it and then immediately be able to do it so [laugh]",1025,261
17,79,interviewer,"Do you think it's a, um... I've struggled to find the right word for this throughout all the interviews. Do you think it's like an integral parkour movement? Is it something that people should try and learn to do parkour? Should is a very strong word but...",198,47
17,80,participant,"Yeah. I think that's that's interesting, I guess i think about it more like it's a classic parkour movement. Like it is iconic but when you're working like I teach... well I do like monthly kind of women's workshops and more most of the women who come to those classes are like 40 year old moms. And that's why I do kind of like a separate women's thing, because that's a space that they're comfortable coming to where it's not like, Okay, I'm not with a bunch of 20 something buff dudes, like this is like, you know, a safe space, so we're not going to be trying to throw down and do crazy things. So with them, I don't necessarily do that right away, especially if they're returning to movement after not having done that kind of thing. So I don't necessarily think it's, you have to be able to do a Kong to say that you do parkour, if you will. Because it's one of many, many different ways to get over an obstacle. Now, I do think it is like iconic and recognisable, and one of those things like that people who don't do parkour will see that be like, Oh, that's parkour, like, I know what that is. And depending on like your level of movement, of course, like, you want to learn that because it is useful. But there's plenty of other ways to get over walls. And that's not like a vault I would start people on, solely, because it does require a certain amount of power and coordination like that. More so I think, then obviously, like step vault, or some of the more basic ways to get over something that's especially when you're working with a population that doesn't necessarily have the inherent strength, or isn't comfortable trying to produce power, or is concerned about what might happen to them if they fall, I tend to focus more on Okay, let's build your confidence with other ways to get over a box. And then as we're doing that, we're building coordination, building that kind of thing. So I tend to start with like, step vaults and doing like the butt spin, like sitting on the box and swinging your legs over. And that I think, is a really nice way to start. Because that shows people hey, you don't have to be able to do these power moves to start. So that's kind of why I shy away from saying it's like, you can't like it's not integral to being able to do parkour. Because I want people to be able to see parkour and not go, Oh, I could never do that and not try it. So I have a little bit of bias in that sense, in that I'm, you know, the type of coaching I do is trying to get people involved in show them hey, like, I know, you saw people jumping across rooftops, in a video that you looked up on Google when you're trying to find out what this was. And we're not going to do that because you know, you you don't start jumping rooftops, you start on the ground jumping, like from pavement lines. So, I would say definitely classic and iconic, but not integral to doing parkour.",2235,554
17,81,interviewer,"It's funny, because I've heard some other people describe it as like, a basic vault. But you know, you were just talking about a population that it's actually more likely to be more of an advanced vault for them. So do you think do you think it is a basic vault, a basic movement in the parkour toolbox? Or does it depend on on the population? The individual?",280,68
17,82,participant,"Yeah, I think about it, I guess like, your parkour. Like Parkour is such an individualised thing. For some people, that is going to be a basic vault. And that's the people who like have no issue learning that. For some people, like for me, now, it's part of my basic vault toolbox. But when I started, it wasn't, that was I didn't even learn that within the first few years of starting, because it's kind of intimidating. So I think it depends on where you're at with your parkour. I'm not going to ask a 43 year old mom who knows may not have the hip mobility or control or upper body strength to be able to get that push to kind of work on that. I want to get her to a point of feeling confident with other ways to get over a box and build that up. So I think it depends, like I said, on the person as what is you consider basic for yourself. It's, and honestly, we don't even teach that with our kids classes. That's not something that they that they learn until they get to our like, intermediate class, because it is one of the ones that's trickier to teach. And especially, well, especially with kids, there's a certain level you need to be at in terms of maturity and coordination. If they're too young, they have a really hard time learning certain things because it's too many things to keep track of. We see that even kind of originally trying to work on like lazy vaults with some of the younger ones, that can be really difficult for them and it's a matter of like development and coordination. So I wouldn't necessarily class like, class it as a basic vault for all populations. That's if you are in, I guess Parkour is very much skewed towards like 20 to 30 year old people who might inherently have the kind of power and body confidence to be able to do that, like they inherently have that athleticism. But if you're starting at a level that you don't have that athleticism, it's not going to be basic, and it's going to take time to learn. Because like I said, it is mental when you haven't worked in that way before or you're not comfortable going headfirst, or, you know, you got to work up the strength and the mobility to do it. So, I think as parkour has kind of grown, and the population of who's doing it has kind of changed. Some of our definitions have had to kind of broaden, I think, and like I said, definitely iconic. Definitely something everybody should work towards, because I do think it is a useful vault. And I think it's a really nice one to kind of intro with generally low consequence, some of the mental elements like that one can be pretty mental. But I don't think it's like, oh, if you can't do the Kong, you can't do parkour.",2070,507
17,83,interviewer,"Do you find... Hm. This is great in a way, because you've actually like, quite naturally moved on to a lot of the questions that I follow up with people. So I'm just thinking... Okay. Is there anything kind of about that Kong vault movement that you would like to know more about? Or that you're curious about yourself?",245,59
17,84,participant,"Hmm. I mean, I'm always I'm always looking for different ways to like, cue it and try different things like as, as a coach, the different ways like hearing other people talk about movements, is really interesting. And I like to kind of hear how people describe them. Because that's useful to me to say, Oh, I hadn't thought of describing it that way. That gives me another tool in my toolbox for trying to help students understand kind of what they need to do and all of that, I feel like I have a pretty solid understanding at this point. But there's always plenty more to learn. I mean, for myself, I have like my own challenges, I'm working on level Kong pres, building more power, all that kind of thing. I guess I'm interested to see at least with the results of this study, kind of how people think about it. But I would love to know, I've talked with a lot of women about this, because like I said, I've done a lot of coaching of women. And actually a friend of mine, who was the one who sent me this study and was like, hey, you're a female coach, like go get in on this, I want to make sure we like have some representation, because I found, um, I feel not always but a lot of the time, women have a harder time learning it. And I think there's like a few pieces to that. But I'm, I'd be interested to find out more about kind of the potential gender divide of how people approach learning the Kong vault, or the difficulties or struggles they have, like the Kong vault. Like I have some theories, there's a certain amount of like, I think, anatomically, because women carry more weight and our centre of gravity is lower. That helps us with balance, but I think it's harder for Kong vault when like with medicine is like because your centre of gravity is in your chest. It's easier for you to lift your hips. But I also think it's a certain amount of like body confidence, competence and upper body strength, like, how we've been socialised in terms of our own personal thoughts about ourselves in an athletic way, and like our thoughts of our own capability. But I'd be really interested to learn more about that, especially like as a coach, who does teach women a lot. So.",1696,412
17,85,interviewer,"Have you found, have you encountered any of those kinds of attitudes in parkour do you think women are treated differently in the sport, in terms of teaching, teaching and coaching?",147,31
17,86,participant,"I think it very much depends on the community. I was very lucky that the community that I stumbled upon was extremely, extremely respectful and treated me completely normally. And it was no big deal. Like they're doing giant jumps, and I am doing my tiny jumps on the sidewalk. Like that was never an issue and everybody was very supportive and just celebrated everybody's success, it didn't matter if you're jumping, you know, 2 feet or 12 feet, that was like everyone was, you know, had a very healthy community vibe, but I've also been to communities where I've visited and like, I did one pull up, and somebody was like, Oh, my God, a girl can do a pull up. And it was just like, um, so I think it very much depends on the community, and the leadership behind the community, because I think most often that has to do with a certain amount of exposure and the culture that is being created. And when you can create a culture that is inclusive, then you're going to, you know, have that kind of healthier culture, when you're not used to seeing women training. And then when they do, you don't know how to react, or people get, sometimes people are excited, which is great. But sometimes people get a little too excited, and then just want to like baby you and help you along. So there is kind of a right way of how to do that. But I think it depends on the community and the maturity of the leaders of that community and how they're kind of creating that culture and having conversations about it. Because I know that's, if people just don't know, like, they don't mean any harm, giving people unsolicited advice. But just because you don't intend any harm, doesn't mean there isn't some kind of harm that can happen from that.",1350,320
17,87,interviewer,"Yeah, I mean, that was kind of my next question is, is even in the inclusive welcoming communities or, or positive communities, have you, have you found any like, assumptions? Or, generally, you know, it's all guys doing it, doing parkour, have you found that, you know, they've been telling you things you just like, Yeah, that's great, if you're a guy [laugh] Or anything like that?",293,67
17,88,participant,"Um, I do find, well, the reason that I am passionate about coaching women is because when I started, I was pretty much the only girl. So I did a lot of anything. Part of the reason I became a coach was because I did a lot of my own figuring out progressions and adaptations. I'm like, Alright, they're doing this really big jump that I definitely can't do. And I'm not even gonna attempt. So what can I do that's still like, training with them, but not the thing that they're doing. So I've found a lot of like, it's important to me to be able to help women get to that point, because I don't know, it's, it's tough to start that way. And, you know, you need a certain mindset to do it. And like, like I said, if I hadn't fallen into a community that was inclusive, it probably, I may not be here today, you know, 10 years later, I might not have done parkour at all. So, I do think there's, there's perhaps certain assumptions, but in an inclusive community, they tend to be if people have those assumptions, if your community is like healthy and has a good culture, people aren't going to put those assumptions on to you, per se. So you're not going to like, air,your assumption of like, oh, women do this thing. But there are certain like, tends to be observed behaviours, and I don't know if that's like a societal socialisation. I've seen like people discuss, like the way that women tend to jump, which is like kicking your feet behind you. I've heard people like call that a girl jump. That's I don't know. It just says a thing. Like, a lot of women tend to do apparently.",1203,302
17,89,interviewer,I've not heard that. That's strange.,27,6
17,90,participant,"Yeah. As opposed to like lifting the knees and reaching forward with the feet. It's lifting the knees, but kicking your feet behind you, and then having to bring them forward. Which, like I've seen it, I'm like, Okay, I understand what you mean. I didn't necessarily associate that as like a thing that women do. But so I've heard I've heard some, like, interesting kind of things with that. But I think it tends to be like more like, oh, women tend to be better balanced for this scientific reason. If you're in like, kind of a healthy community, or if you have particular thoughts about that. You just like don't air that to people. And that's, I think, the kind of healthier way to do it. But I think another healthy thing with communities is being able to discuss it in a respectful manner. Like because, like I said, I'm, I'm the only woman on the coaching team where I work. So being able to be like, yeah, like what you're doing doesn't work for me. This is what I do instead, and being able to have that I think especially since we're, we've had a lot of growth in the past few years with, like female students, especially with adults. So being like, me being able to be like, yeah, this is like, this is what the tall buff dudes are doing. And this is what I do, I think is a helpful thing, because then you don't necessarily have to find your own way to start out, especially in a coached environment, that can be kind of tricky. So and I think it does help the guys to have those conversations, because then they can be like, relate that to students as well and be like, oh, like, this is the way I do it. But I know that Melissa does it this way. So to have that experience of seeing, like, multiple things done in kind of varied ways, or the specific progressions that I tend to do for certain things for various people, I think is useful. So I think a key to that is being able to have like respectful conversations around those differences. Kind of a roundabout way to answer that question, but [laugh]",1557,382
17,91,interviewer,"And do you, I mean, you might not be able to answer this, but do you see that as something that's happening, is, are things improving in that way? Or is parkour still, all dudes all the time?",145,38
17,92,participant,"I think it's definitely improving. Especially like, I mean, I started in like college. So it's a bunch of like, buff dudes doing things. And let's like, I don't know, you know, this was the perfect stereotype of a bunch of like, buff guys jumping on things, doing crazy stuff. But I think as it's grown, and especially as it's gotten older, and there's been more actual coaching, because I was not the type of person, a lot of the guys I know, there was like the YouTube generation who all learned from online videos, and I was not the person who was going to look at a video and be like, yeah, I think I'm going to try to chuck myself over this thing face first, you know. So I think as coaching has become more available, that has really kind of helped to shift the balance of things. And now a lot more people know what it is they know, like, there's a certain understanding of you don't have to have a certain physical basis to be able to start parkour that's slowly shifting, that's still like a battle that you have, which is like the person looking at and going, Oh, I could never do that. But I think that's starting to shift a little bit more, but at the same time you're still fighting against, as social media has gotten bigger, now, there's kind of like a balance between the coaching side where it's like, okay, I can go somewhere and learn how to do it and have somebody who knows what they're doing teach me. But then also the people seeing, you know, like, the Storror videos, and you know, all this stuff that have people doing crazy, insane things, and being like, Oh my god, like, that's parkour, there's no way. So it's kind of trying to find that balance. But I do think definitely, things have improved, there's been a lot more women, I think, getting involved and a lot more people who are older, like we're starting to slowly break out of the, you know, 20 something demographic, and that's, I think, in part to making it more accessible and, you know, starting at a point and what kind of what I would touched on before with Kongs, whether or not it's a basic vault, you know, be like it doesn't, you can do a Kong and do parkour, or you can not like there's your version of parkour and your level of parkour and you like, there's not a specific baseline that you must start at. So I think that as people have become more aware of that, and like I said, I think coach settings have made a lot of difference, when you can have someone to talk to you and give you specific feedback. Rather than looking at a video trying to do the thing. Looking at your video of you doing the thing, comparing it to the video. It lets you serve a lot more different learning styles and give people kind of a certain amount of I think there is like that mental security, if you will. Of like, Okay, I'm with someone who knows what they're doing. So I feel more comfortable doing this. They're not going to let hurt myself badly. Whereas, as I lovingly call it, when you're 20 something watching YouTube chucking stupid, like, you don't know [laugh] And that's like, someone who's 40 is not going to do that because they're like, man, if I break my hip, that's gonna be a problem for me. Yeah.",2463,604
17,93,interviewer,"Yeah. So kind of bring it back round to the Kong vault because that is in theory, what the study is about [laugh] Yeah, I really like that description of it, of it. Of not thinking of it as a basic vault or an advanced vault or anything like that, but just something you can learn and if you like it you keep going. You can make it more advanced if you want to, or or not. Just kind of leaving up to the individual.",319,85
17,94,participant,"Yeah, that's I heard someone wants to describe it parkour as it's it's not like parkour, it's your parkour, like what you are doing is your parkour. And I think that's really important because it's so easy in parkour to fall into that comparison trap, and think, like, Oh, I'm no good, because I can't do X, Y, and Z. But you still have your particular parkour your strengths, your journey of what you're working on, and maybe the Kong vault is part of that, or maybe you're working on ground Kongs. But there's, the beauty of Parkour is there's a way to adapt, not everything, but nearly everything. So that it's accessible to people, wherever they happen to be a,t it's not, you have to have a certain level of strength to do this thing. It's like, okay, you don't have the strength to do this thing. So we're going to start here and build that strength. It just has so many nice adaptations for everything. Part, I think, if you're only watching, like, you know, videos of really advanced athletes, you don't see that quite as much.",792,190
17,95,interviewer,"Yeah. The thing I find really curious about that is, you know, it's this wide open thing, you can make it what you want. Then contrasting that with coaching, where you kind of need some structure to pass along.",164,39
17,96,participant,Yeah.,4,1
17,97,interviewer,Right? Is that fair to say?,20,6
17,98,participant,[overlap] Yeah.,11,2
17,99,interviewer,So kind of contrasting those two things.,33,7
17,100,participant,"I think the interesting thing with that, so we kind of talked about before, like what actually constitutes a kong, like the particular movement pattern and the order in which you do things. So it's, it's back to that idea of adjusting it to whatever you're going to work on. So whether you're doing you know, Kongs, dive Kongs at like 10 feet high, and then you know, landing and rolling out or you're doing just like little monkey hop, the ground Kongs, you can still take that motion and kind of adjust, okay, I'm going to do this just on the ground, no consequence, or I'm going to do this very high consequence, need to stick my landing, you know, have to don't want to clip my feet on this one, type of idea. So as long as you're doing those kind of that particular movement pattern, that's still going to be your Kong. And that's like where progressions come into it. So that's what coaching, coaching done well, is not just I'm going to show you this thing, and now you try. But that's why breaking the movement apart into pieces, working on specific bits, putting it back together, progressing through each of those is really key. And that's what allows you to keep the integrity of the movement and adapt it to pretty much any scenario.",969,229
17,101,interviewer,"Yeah, I like that word, adapt. Like, there's a basic movement pattern that you can kind of... well yeah, adapt it to the environment, to the individual...",115,27
17,102,participant,"Yep. So as long as like you're working that particular like, okay, here's like a drill working on keeping your knees between your hands. Like that's still working on the Kong, but that's at, you know, the level of someone working on the mobility to be able to, you know, lift their hips and keep their knees inwards as opposed to the person who's You know, I'm diving across a huge space, or I'm doing my Kong to cat to, you know, wall flip or whatever.",347,86
17,103,interviewer,"So, do you think that those kind of patterns... I really like the word, classic parkour movement, I'm definitely stealing that. But it's this like collection of things that people you know, you go to a class, there's like a collection of movements, they've got names. There's certain ways you're coached them. Like, there's, there's some structure to it, but you can adapt it in a lot of different ways.",310,70
17,104,participant,"Yeah, well, and I think different communities have done different things. So like, it tends to all be colloquial after a certain point. Because I know I've visited other communities and they're like, Oh, yeah, we're doing this movement. And I'm like, the what? And they do it like, Oh, yeah, this thing. We call it this, like, so. There's plenty of like, kind of sharing in that. And that's why I think travel is one of the things that's really important to parkour because there are tonnes of ways that people have done things as it's kind of grown in kind of little spaces and then expanded from there. So I think you, yeah, being able to have like, there are like the classic bases, basic things that we think of as parkour. But then there's like tonnes of stuff that people make up all the time. And that's, you know, I would say still part of their parkour as well, you can decide if your parkour includes flips or whatever. So there's no reason you can't decide if it's going to include Kong vaults, depending on the level of where you're at.",808,194
17,105,interviewer,"And do you think those kind of classic movements that kind of like, yeah, classic toolset kind of emerged because they've just proven to be particularly useful, and they've just kind of survived, whereas perhaps other stuff has come and gone? Is there, is it like, is there like a core set of movements that are kind of like, these are really useful, we've passed them on, but you can do what you want around it?",323,76
17,106,participant,"I think it's a combination of what's useful, and also some of what was done first. Because we're young enough that we still can see our roots. So it's like, oh, these were like, here's X, Y and Z original movements. So like, that's, these are in the parkour Hall of Fame. Like everybody knows what the Yamak did, and like, Kong vault were part of that. So that's why I call it like, classic and iconic. Um, so I think a lot of it kind of stems from that. But then there's people who are like innovating and doing all kinds of crazy stuff, and like, how can I combine this roll with this vault, and you know, like, it's, it's constantly evolving. So there's a certain amount of creativity and I think the basics are considered like the the basics or the classics, because they were the first things. And they are like, the building blocks, if you will, you can, there's a lot you can do from them. Whereas some of like, a lot of the newer, really creative stuff is like, okay, you have to have a certain basis in like acrobatics, to be able to replicate that. So I think that kind of has to do with like, okay, these are the originals, the building blocks, this is therefore what people know, they're super useful. And then you can add flourish to it. So I feel like a lot of the newer kind of creative stuff is like, you still use those building blocks. And then what can I add to them or tweak about them? But yeah, the usefulness definitely, is part of it. But again, I do think it has to do with, it was the original things that people did. So that's like, what parkour was. We're not gonna be like, oh, we're throwing out this vault, like, the founders are still alive, for heaven's sake, you know, like, we're way too young to start kind of trying to pick and choose in that way. Just as a sport in general, I feel. And I mean, the founders were all about usefulness, specifically. So that's, like, part of why, like, those movements are still around is like, Oh, yeah, this is really useful, like, doing, you know, metres and metres of QM sucks, but you're going to get real strong, and it's going to help you with like, all of these different movements. So that's why it's still around, not maybe not as flashy is doing a double backflip. But you know, that's still like a necessary part of it.",1751,438
17,107,interviewer,"Yeah, these things have kind of proven themselves over time. And so they get passed on.",69,16
17,108,participant,"Yep. And I think they're some of the most adaptable, as we kind of mentioned before, like, you're able to dress them up and make them very difficult. Or you can start at this very accessible level.",153,37
17,109,interviewer,"I like that description of building blocks. I think that's, that's a good way to think about. Um, I'm aware of the time, I don't want to take up your entire day. Is there anything else that you, that's maybe popped in your head at any point or any thoughts that we didn't get to or anything else you'd like to add?",238,62
17,110,participant,"Uh, trying to think, I mean, I think I think we kind of hit on everything that I wanted to, just like the basics talking about different populations learning Kong vault, that was one I wanted to make sure to hit on, just based on like my experience, and a lot of the like, women I know who have learned it versus the experience of men learning it versus the experience of you know, older or younger populations. So I think I think we pretty much hit on everything that I had in my head is like this is an important kind of piece. So.",417,105
17,111,interviewer,"Cool. Well, we've likewise gone through pretty much all the important sections I like to try and get to so yeah, unless there's anything else I'll I'll stop the recording.",134,30
17,112,participant,No.,2,1
17,113,interviewer,"Cool. Okay, one second.",17,4
18,1,interviewer,"Okay, there we go. So, yeah, as a, as we kind of went through the study is just kind of talking about how some of the movements in parkour have, have kind of spread, how people have come to understand them in their own various ways, and how they coach them to other people as well. And I picked the Kong vault as just a particularly well known movement. So I guess the first thing to kind of start with is, is Kong vault the term familiar to you? Or do you call it something else?",372,96
18,2,participant,"When I very very first started I think I called it Kong vault, but then I like transitioned into catpass, as I was, like, trying to be a bit more respectful to the, you know, the original name of it.",153,40
18,3,interviewer,"Was that, was that just something you felt like doing? Or is that something you felt other people were doing as well?",93,22
18,4,participant,"I think I may have seen posts on dot net, parkour dot net about it or something like that. And I think, you know, I saw the terms first on urban free flow or something, and so it just, I also came from kind of like a martial arts background. So I guess there was like, this idea of like, trying to be respectful to like the ones that came before you, you know, and so it was just like an attempt at this, I suppose.",317,86
18,5,interviewer,So you use the term catpass now?,25,7
18,6,participant,"Yeah, catpass, sometimes Kong vault, but it's it's interchangeable I don't, you know. Yeah.",69,14
18,7,interviewer,"Do you- I'll try and I'll try and use catpass for the interview. Just for consistency. But yeah, I'll probably slip up because I've called it Kong Vault for 12 years now. Which is weird to think about.",154,38
18,8,participant,"Yeah, that makes sense. Like, as I started learning, like, I'm in Turkey, right? I'm not Turkish, obviously. But like, you know, when my wife and I are talking, you'll end up being like a Turk-lish sometimes, you know what I mean? And I think it's, similarly if you're training with people that use different terminology, I find it's originally I was like, Oh, we should all like have a unified something or other. And I'm sure that would be helpful. But it's also like, I think, maybe it's good for the brain to like, just know, like, this might be what this thing is called. And you could just understand it immediately. You know, like, you know, elma is another word for apple in Turkish. So I don't think of like, Oh, okay. Elma means apple, I'm like, ah elma's like this thing, apple's this thing, too. It's just, you know, catpass, Kong, whatever, it's the same thing.",655,160
18,9,interviewer,"And so, just to kind of start us off then, how would you describe a catpass? Very broad question.",75,19
18,10,participant,"Yeah, it's a good one, I need to think about this. For me, a catpass is a linear vault where you're travelling, you know, forward, generally, perpendicular with an obstacle and the idea is to kind of have a symmetrical push with your hands, and tuck with your knees to pass over it, the legs don't usually pass through, you're kind of blocking your body and counter balancing to fly over it. Like a kind of a tuck.",320,78
18,11,interviewer,So the hands come out onto the obstacle first?,37,9
18,12,participant,"Yeah. So you'll reach hands first into the obstacle, and you kind of start to jump, then lift the hips up, then you'll push with your arms as you tuck. So it kind of let that combination of movements boost you over the obstacle.",177,44
18,13,interviewer,"So you mentioned there that the, I can't remember if you said feet or legs, but they don't come through the hands. Does that mean like the hands come off the obstacle and your whole body just travels over?",161,39
18,14,participant,"Yeah, generally, you know, people, when they see the movement, they seem to get that feeling that like, okay, I can't do it, you know, if my feet can't get through my hands, but if anything, I feel like the only thing that maybe passes through that vertical line of where your hands are posted, would be you know, your knees before you're lifting off of the obstacle. So and you're in way more of like, like a tucked planche kind of position than any kind of squatting, you know, like the kash vault you know, where you would actually need to be able to get your, your legs through. So, if you're feeling like your feet have to get through before your hands are lifted I think it's making the movement, not harder but, I mean, harder for me for sure [laugh] but you know, it's making it a little bit different as well.",629,155
18,15,interviewer,"So are the, are the arms or the hands pushing on the obstacle as well?",54,15
18,16,participant,"Yeah, it's like a combination of pull and push. I used to focus way more on the pull when I started and I then a friend of mine, Pedro as a co-worker when I was working in Dubai and I could see he focused a little bit more on the push. And I saw that had like, this combination of that this push and this lift is like I think super useful for getting power in  variable circumstances, you know, like on a wall, maybe you can get a real good pull or at a bar if you're standing. But if you're like running at a bar, you know, you don't really have that same ability.",432,117
18,17,interviewer,"What, what's kind of the difference between push and pull in the movement? How does it affect it?",76,18
18,18,participant,"I see. For me, I found that the push helps me better transfer my run. So when I'm starting to go for more maximal distances for me, my worry isn't so much as I don't worry as much about getting a really, really good pull, and then transferring into the push, I start to worry more about having a very smooth transition of momentum from my run into my push, if that makes sense.",292,74
18,19,interviewer,"So are you the pushing, by push versus pull, like push down onto the obstacle to go up?",67,18
18,20,participant,"For me, yeah, exactly. Pushing down on the obstacle, it's like the most most akin to like a push up type movement, literally, where you're pushing more towards the front of your body. And then what I consider more of a pull would be like, like a front lever kind of movement, where you're going from overhead, because you're leaned down, you know, towards that obstacle, and you're bringing the obstacle kind of in front of you and underneath you is what I would consider more pulling. So it's, you know, that was, I guess, using more lat kind of involvement, versus this push is really, you know, triceps pecs, biceps kind of stuff. ",491,114
18,21,interviewer,"So, do you still use the pull at all? Would, or are you just all about push now?",59,18
18,22,participant,"No, 100%, I think the one thing that I'm kind of big on is like, the there's, you know, the maximal effective technique, if you're trying to get distance, in this case, for a catpass is gonna look different depending on the speed that you're entering, you know, if you're, if you're doing a standing catpass, or, you know, just the split foot, you're gonna need to rely on different aspects of your body to give you that, to give you that, that momentum and that power. And so I feel like, for me, if I'm on the more static end of the spectrum, as far as the moments and that I have before the catpass, I might rely more on the pull. And then as my speed prior to the catpass starts to increase, I might start to rely more on the push.",558,144
18,23,interviewer,"So the pull can kind of generate some some power for travelling? If you are, if you haven't got that from from your run up?",95,25
18,24,participant,"Yeah, I think so. It helps me get that initial, you know, launch forward into it. I then can push down into the obstacle and block over it as I as I tuck, you know.",123,35
18,25,interviewer,"I mean, you started to talk about takeoffs a bit there. Are there particular ways to take off for the movement?",88,21
18,26,participant,"Yeah, I think there's a lot of ways, for me, I guess the three main ways I would say is punch, which is jumping off two feet, kind of like a plyo, a technical plyo, not like a physical exercise plyo. The split foot, which I find closest to like, a hurdle in gymnastics, or a gallop, which is like a one sided skip. And then the last one that I see the least but it still exists is like just a straight running stride. You don't do any, you know, like a one foot takeoff kind of thing. Obviously, there's others, there's step ups, and you can tac into it or you can, whatever, there's so many different ways, but I think those are like, from the ground the three kind of classic, or most common ways I would say.",540,141
18,27,interviewer,"Yeah, there's always gonna be like, wild variations on every, on everything, right?",65,13
18,28,participant,"Yeah. And even variations inside it, you know, like the same for , one of my friends is a gymnast. And seeing his plyo is way more like the classic exercise one because he's hitting the hell out of the ground as he's used to a springboard, you know, whereas, even when I plyo it's, I'm trying to be soft, you know, I'm not smashing into the ground because I'm not used to being on something springy, I'm used to being on the ground. So even that can change. I, I've seen people split foot, you know, hybrid split foot plyo, or use way more kick in their split foot, you know [unclear]",443,112
18,29,interviewer,"Do those, perhaps more with the, like, more common ones that you mentioned, rather than worrying about all the edge cases, are there, how do they kind of affect the movement? If they do?",145,34
18,30,participant,"Um, I think, you know, Parkour is kind of cool in that you can always you know, if you have those little, my sister in law has like a little kid now so watching her do puzzles and stuff like that, you know, there's like, can't fit like a square peg in a round hole or something like this. And I feel like there's a lot of times where you can, you can cheat a bit and get, you know, what you want, but from different techniques, but for me, like the split foot is, ends up being kind of the most bang for your buck take off, kind of like the pareto principle, if takeoffs were 80%, of what you want to do with the catpass, maybe can be done with this, with this split foot, which is why it's it's useful to to learn, I think, but I think when I was younger, I kind of attributed the split foot with, since it's a smoother transition from run into the vault, it's better for getting like distance. And then I would use the plyo, or, you know, the punch, if I was trying to go up on something higher. But I find these days, I'm mostly sticking with a split foot or doing like, a split foot plyo, where I'm not heel driving as much as I might for a normal split foot. But that being said, you know, if you're doing a running jump into a catpass, you're generally going to be taking off two feet, just like the punch. So I think both are both are useful, depending on the purpose of it. If I'm connecting in a kind of dense area, or after a precision or for rails, you know, I'm not, you're not split footing on a rail pretty easily. So it's generally going to be that punch take off. And then if I'm on the, if I'm doing something that I'm able to take off on the ground, or you know, a decent enough wall, then it's gonna be a split foot.",1312,349
18,31,interviewer,And is that because it's just kind of blends that forward motion into the movement easier?,73,16
18,32,participant,"Yeah, I think it has been way, way more gentle, exactly, you illustrated it perfectly, a gentle sort of acceleration or transference of that momentum, rather than a potentially abrupt, you know, angular shift.",167,34
18,33,interviewer,"And how about on the other side of the obstacle? Are there particularly common ways to land from it? Or, you started to mention connecting it to other movements as well?",135,31
18,34,participant,"Yeah, I think I mean, I think two foot landing is a great starter. So you know, if somebody was doing catpass, I would have them start with that, obviously, not start with that. But if they're actually clearing the, you know, the catpass, already, they would just have them land precision, since it's a potentially safer, more stable place, you know, and then after that, you know, they'd start to run out of it, and I kind of think of it, there's, I had a funny, I don't know if it's a compensation, but a funny habit, where we did like an endurance challenge, where we were doing 50 different movements of seven different movements or something like this. And when we got to the catpasses, I was like, being real sure to switch up which foot I was split footing with every single time, so that I would just not fatigue one side of my body more than the other. But I still noticed about halfway through, I was like, my left leg is like, hella tired, what's going on, you know, I'm just unknowingly, even though I was switching my entry my, my landing was left foot stepping out every single time. And so, you know, making sure to, you know, years and years ago, but, you know, I think it's good to to be ambidextrous in that. And that's too, you know, ease the load. So, I think stepping out in stride, and precision are probably the classic ones. And then, second from that, if I'm going, if I'm stepping out of it, I find theres kind of like two ways that I'll generally step out of it. One is I'll keep one knee higher, and just go out of it running. And then the second one is, as I'm exiting it'll be more similar to that stride where one foot or swing through, one foot reaches down while the non-landing leg reaches behind so that as soon as the landing foot makes contact, I can kick through into a jump or keep my momentum going. And I feel like it really lessens the impact on the single leg takeoff. So if I have the space or the momentum, this is the one I generally like to go with.",1530,384
18,35,interviewer,"Is it quite an impactful landing from a kong vault, perhaps in comparison to other vaults?",73,16
18,36,participant,"I would say so, I think it's probably one of the most dynamic, what's it called, dynamic basic vaults that we have, you know, the only one that I personally feel like I get higher on is, is like my reverse vaults sometimes. So what I'm kind of thinking of, in respects to impact in this case is like, where are my hips in relation to the ground or the place that I'm landing? And then also, you know, how dynamic is the movement, something like a step vault, your hips get to stay really low. And you can see that we don't have to have any amount of dynamism or I don't know what to say, to the amount of, you know, speed into your landing. But for the catpass, you know, if you're doing your catpass, like, you might be an arm's length away from, you know, the obstacle, then you might get some lift after that, and then you're having to take that landing, you know, as well. So I think it's probably one of the most dynamic, impactful landings that there couldn't be.",740,187
18,37,interviewer,Does that make it potentially harder to come out of it with like a single leg landing compared to some other vaults? And so maybe connect it to other movements?,129,30
18,38,participant,"Yeah, I think, just from my experience, doing it and teaching it, I would say so. But that being said, I feel like you know, most people get the get the hang of one kind of way, sooner or the other, but the two foot way tends to be the natural, you know, the first one, the first one, but is that the natural one, because most of the time when people teach they're teaching precision jumps, so they're locking in this landing technique, you know, I've never had a student when I said, I'm not going to teach them precisions or landing catpass, then I'm just going to teach them and have it stepping out. Sometimes I've seen people do it naturally. But you know, more often than not, it's that two foot kind of stability landing. And I think that is a piece of it does have some more impact. Not a lot, but.",617,156
18,39,interviewer,"You're kind of coming off the obstacle, and you're just in midair, almost as if you are doing that precision, you don't have that limb kind of behind you lowering you down, like you're do in some, even something like a dash vault, to a degree.",187,46
18,40,participant,"Yeah, exactly. 100%. Yeah, that dash vault, you can, even when you're powering into it, the momentum is kind of hitting different, you know, I feel like if you're doing the catpass itself, it's kind of like, you're getting this dip and then this lift after it. Whereas with the dash, I feel like you're, you can still get a lot of power from that movement. But because your hips are still low, you know what I mean? If you think of, for a dash versus the catpass, what gives you... your hips start low, and then that explosive hip extension, lifts the hips up to help you get more power out of it. But for the catpass, you're putting your hips high, and your catpassing and putting your hips even higher. You know.",545,134
18,41,interviewer,"You mentioned the dip, is that like a dip before the obstacle, like, as a counter movement jump?",75,18
18,42,participant,"Yeah a, a slight dip, I feel like this is again, one of those things that is most beneficial for for the slow to medium speed entries. And it's, I mean, the theory, at least behind it that seemed to make sense for me and why I kept up with it is that it allows me a little bit more range of motion, you know, versus having to just push up the obstacle from, you know, here or here, I'm able to actually do, you know, up above and get my hands on the obstacle for a longer time, thus potentially generating more power into it.",402,106
18,43,interviewer,"So it gives you more range of motion with the upper body, with the arms.",56,15
18,44,participant,"And with the jumping leg, as well. I find that there's another thing like to take like a like an ancillary movement, at least entry wise like the webster. That's one that I see people struggle with a lot of times because they're so upright in the movement the whole time, and then they just, you know, are flying down. And I think you can see that a little bit with a catpass, too, if people are, you know how sometimes they'll anticipate the obstacle, and now, they'll have the brakes kind of on. So since the brakes are on their chest is a little bit down in back. And so then they're throwing their weight down into the obstacle, rather than just kind of skipping it off like a stone. And I think the dip can help people naturally do that.",577,142
18,45,interviewer,"I mean, I guess it's like any other, jumping in a way, you come down to go up?",56,18
18,46,participant,"Exactly, yes.",10,2
18,47,interviewer,"Naturally, almost.",15,2
18,48,participant,Yeah. Makes sense. That's a good way to say it.,34,10
18,49,interviewer,"And right at the start, as well, I made a note that you also mentioned the hips coming up, which is something that's come up in quite a few other discussions I've had, do they have to, is that like, an important component, the hips getting up quite high?",196,49
18,50,participant,"Yeah, I think so many, it depends, again, on the type of move, if you're doing something like a double Kong, double catpass, like your hips are going super high, but but you want to get them high enough that you are able to, I think, use your arms and get that clearance and get back to the you know, get back to landing on your feet, but it's on top of the obstacle or, or over it. So I generally, you know, want people to at least think about getting their hips, level with their head when they're, you know, doing the movement itself. And I think that also helps accentuate that lift that someone might need to, to get that feeling of weight on the arms is I think one of the biggest pieces of it, because if you're if you, you know, you've seen probably people do the like, they can clear the obstacle, and they kind of, like, touch it, right, and they and they stay very vertical that whole time. And people can do that 100%, but you can see that the, the arms aren't aiding them really in the movement that much. And in my perspective, you know, the clearance is way less, therefore, it's a more risky manoeuvre to keep your body vertical, rather than get it, you know, more inverted. So for me, I think the big benefits are more clearance for the legs, it helps give that, I kind of, think of it like a hammer, like, you know, our hips are generally where the centre of gravity is. So when you, if you throw a hammer up, it kind of spins in a weird metre, you know, it doesn't circle, it doesn't spin around smoothly. So by lifting those hips up, and then at the very end of that lift, being able to push, you know, jump, push and tuck, it can get you even higher. And it lets you put the weight on your arms, so you have the ability to push. Because I think for me, technically, when I'm doing like, any kind of parkour movement, I'm trying to ask myself, how much, how much power can I generate from every part of my body, you know, you know, even for something like a jump, the, you know, the arm swing itself can add, you know, a foot of distance to your jump, if not more than I think if you are you really want to get the most out of your arms for the catpass for a safety standpoint?",1673,432
18,51,interviewer,Does bringing the hips up mean that you need to reorientate yourself for a landing in that case?,78,18
18,52,participant,"Yeah, I think that's part of what that that last block in that push does is it helps, right you and angle the, you know, angle your chest or your spine in the direction that it needs to be, you know, if you're wanting to continue, if this is your head, you know, maybe you're only going to this, you know, but if you're going for like a catpass precision, you're rotating all the way maybe, you know, to a slightly less slightly past vertical with a backwards lean so that you can get that stick, you know, but that's, I think the arms help you control that, that orientation, that reorientation into the landing a lot.",477,117
18,53,interviewer,"Do you find that people find that kind of you know, getting the hips high and trusting the arms a bit, something a bit intimidating about the movement or or something scary?",139,32
18,54,participant,"Yeah, 100% and and that's why I think you start on the ground. Once they get comfortable in the ground. One of my favourite, like go to kind of obstacles if I'm teaching outside is like a picnic table lengthwise, so that if they do, you know, mess up, they just fall on the ground essentially, you know, at ground level because there's no distance so I think it's 100% an intimidating movement for for some newcomers. Obviously, we've probably all gotten like the, the young bloods that don't really care, this kind of huck it. But, you know, for most normal people kind of getting into it, I think that's sketchy, the only thing they might have done close to it would maybe be like a burpee, you know, if they've, if they, if they're athletic, but even then, you know, it's, I think there's a reason why it's just more risky, right, there's more momentum to do it, therefore, there's more risk associated with it. And then, to get that technique, it just takes some time. And there's that coordination, it's like, same thing, like, if you're trying to do a, you know, a power clean or something like that, you have to, there's a lot of little pieces that you got to get right to, to get that bar up off the ground where it gets your body up on top of that obstacle and feel like, you're not going to shin yourself or knee capitate or you know land on your head. And so I think the ground based stuff, you know, some hand, a lot of handstand side work, if they're not used to that, you know, just getting their body inverted on them with their weight on their arms, so they can learn that they can trust their arms, you know, so that they can get that more horizontal body position, which will then you know, inevitably be safer. It's, you know, we have these habits, you know, we're always upright, things are like this, and we're moving fast, it's probably not a good thing, usually, or, you know, same thing for like backflip, if you're going like this, and you're in the air usually something really bad's happening [laugh] People freak out. Like, well, I don't think it's as hard for people to get the hang of as the backflip mentally, I think it's still 100% of barrier for for some.",1671,408
18,55,interviewer,"I'm curious, because I made a note of this to follow up on. If it's kind of I mean, you know, I don't want to say risky, but it's a riskier vault to learn and stuff. But earlier on, you referred to it as a basic vault.",160,47
18,56,participant,Yeah.,4,1
18,57,interviewer,"Is it, is it something you'd get people to learn pretty early on in their parkour training? Or is it a more advanced movement?",99,24
18,58,participant,"I think if they're, if they don't have any, like red flags, mobility, or strength wise or injury wise, working on it at the ground level, or, you know, on a small ledge, let's say, knee high to hip high, long obstacle that they are not actually having to clear. It 100% can be something that I start with them on, on day one, you know what I mean? Because if I want, if and when I want them to get to the actual movement, I will already want them to have some familiarity with the, with the concept of it.",382,101
18,59,interviewer,"Do you view it like, an integral vault for people to learn? Is it something that's-",64,16
18,60,participant,"Uh, I mean, parkour in and of itself is not really like a integral thing, right? So, like, I don't need to do this anymore for anything, it's just fun, right? So I do... for me, the things that I like to teach people are first the things that I think will make them uncomfortable. And then second, the things that they enjoy, and then I guess, let's say those are second and third, actually and the first would be like, the things that I feel they, they might need as a baseline, you know what I mean? So this would be just like, if they can't squat with the, you know, flat feet or, or if they don't know how to jump or even if they're walking or running, and they're, you know, their knees are tracking in a funky way or their weights, you know, weird on that landing and stuff like that. So I feel like, basic kind of biomechanics is like the first thing that maybe they need, or maybe they naturally do, and then second it it would be, I feel like, you know, by giving them something new, something uncomfortable that, you know, that's not, that's outside of their comfort zone, you know, it doesn't have to be crazy. That's how one of the ways you get better, you know, as a human is just by not, not avoiding what makes you uncomfortable, whether that's conflict, whether that's, you know, the fear of injury or whatever, like that and understand that you you have more control than you think, so as far as like the catpass as a vault? I like it so 100% I like to teach it, you know what I mean? And I do think it has aspects that are unique to it as far as in comparison to other vaults. But um, you know, at the basic level, I would just want somebody to be able to maybe be able to do like a squat on, you know, with the knees on the outside of the feet on top of an obstacle. If that's like, literally as far as they were fussed to get, I wouldn't be that stressed about it, you know, it's they're movement in their body. And I would maybe I would love for them to be able to do like a catpass on top, with the knees inside, but you know, everybody's goals in their life and in their body and for parkour are gonna be different. So if someone's like, that they just don't like the move, but I can see that they're capable of it. And they've showed that they're, like, you know, able to do it, or at least understand it, then it's like, okay, well, then what do you want to work on?",1811,471
18,61,interviewer,"It's been really interesting, because I've, I've asked that question, and I've tried phrasing it a couple different ways. And almost invariably, the answer I've had back is very similar to yours. You know, it's, what what does the person want to get out of parkour, essentially, you know, and you can customise it to yourself. It's interesting for me, kind of part of this research that is, you know, is it I guess a better way to phrase it might be, is it just a really useful vault for people to learn? Is it a good one to have in your toolbox if you can?",427,106
18,62,participant,"As far as it being very useful, if I was thinking like old school, I'm trying to survive type stuff, you know what I mean, like, I feel like you can do most of what you want with like step vaults, you know, you can do a really big jumping step vault, you can get some exit distance from it, it gives you a little bit more control, if you don't know what's happening after. So I feel like you know, the, the only thing that maybe the, the catpass can do is get you further, you know what I mean? If the jump, if the step up is too high, you know, you can also just jump up onto something and jump again, right. So I think it can get you further and, you know, it gives you a little bit of a power boost. I know, if I've been playing like tag like games, I can 100%, you know, run and hit like a catpass and go for like this dive to tag somebody, which might be useful, but I feel like it's, you know, it's dependent on the goal. Like if it's a young person, if they're interested in, you know, maybe one day being competitive, or even just seeing like, what their bodies can do. I think the catpass is a great movement. But if I was, you know, teaching a 50 year old lady, or an old dude that, you know, has had a bunch of injuries, I'm not that fussed with, with her. So I think for me, it's more about like, the stage of life that they're at, you know, if they're, you know, if they're relatively healthy, I think it's a cool movement to learn. And it can add a lot to, I think it gives, it gives a good feeling and stuff like this, but if they're just trying to move better, I don't think it's that important. But if they're trying to move like their fastest, or their most powerfully then yeah, for sure.",1281,344
18,63,interviewer,"The, the thing that it makes me really curious about is, you know, the contrast of this idea of like a very wide open, personalised parkour, and the idea of coaching, where you kind of have to have kind of ideas of what you want to pass along and what you want to teach. And we have these named movements. And it's not like there's a curriculum, or it's like a martial art, where you learn these forms in this order or anything like that. Just contrasting those two, I find really interesting. So is trying to figure out with people, you know, we have these movements. But whenever I ask people about them, they're always like, yeah you can do, you can pick and choose, you can do whatever. So it's like, I mean, you've given very good answers. I just, I've noticed that kind of contrast come up. And I'm really curious how people view that.",649,158
18,64,participant,"Yeah, I mean, if anything, I think it's, it's kind of like the juxtaposition between if you want to take the martial arts for an example, if you you have the form training and you have, you know, the technique training and stuff like that, and then you have sparring, you know what I mean, and so, for example, for my, I haven't done martial arts a long time, like formally or whatever, but for my last belt test, for example, I had to demonstrate like 48 different throws, you know what I mean? But when I'm sparring, or grappling, I use like two or three, you know, those are like my bread and butter and, and rather than, I kind of think of it like there's this horizontal progression, and there's a vertical progression. For me, as an athlete, and as a trainer, my preference is for someone to take a technique and get close to mastery with that, if that makes sense, rather than pile on a bunch of things that they can kind of do if the situation's right. And I think that's, you know, more useful, that's my application for, like I said, just what I explained for martial arts stuff. And I think it applies a lot in parkour, especially if you're doing like improvisation, you know, type games, you know, like tag or? Or, or if you make a mistake during a planned, you know, speed course, or, or if you're just trying to go, you know what I mean, you'll see like, okay, well, I can, I'm comfortable with these vaults, but that's pretty much it, you know, I'm comfortable with these moves. And that's pretty much it. And so I think it's this kind of thing, where there's, there's so much that you can give somebody technique wise with parkour, and there is definitely like a foundational thing, I think, and for me, the basis of the foundations is kind of like that I that I conceptualise is like, what body positions are you put into and what different things are happening. You know, for example, like a similarity, if you take like the the powerful underbar that people do, you know, that's, that's a movement that's similar to what you would do if you were trying to glide Kip. Which is like the gymnastics way to get up on a bar, you know, that's like their muscle up, or it also shares, you know, the hip extension qualities that happen with a deadlift, or that power clean, it also shares that similarities with a Kip up. So like this movement, archetype, I guess, if you will, you know, has has its uses. And so something like a catpass has a has a benefit, that you're not going to get from a step vault, just from a neurological point of view as far as the mind body connection. And hence slightly for me, that's the, that's the where it kind of falls away, right is like, slightly less, if you're just thinking from a purely technical standpoint, you know, because you'll see people dash pre things that people can catpass pre, you know what I mean, you'll see people step vault pre stuff like that, you'll see people do giant, you know, you can probably do a way bigger stride step, you know, when you're jumping straight into step vaults, then you can do a dive Kong, even if you can't, it's at least way safer for your body. Because you're getting to absorb with your leg rather than have to take it all in your wrists. You know what I mean? So if we're thinking just purely from that point of view, for me, the benefits of the catpass are way more mental, I guess. And, and, like I said, just a different move for your CNS than then what it can do for you in the world. You know what I mean? That's, I think, where things get way more subjective, based on body type and desires and goals. So yeah.",2773,681
18,65,interviewer,"So that that kind of movement pattern that dive onto the hands and then, you know, push and pull through. It's just kind of like a foundational pattern that is just useful?",136,32
18,66,participant,"Yeah, I think so. Because it lets you get, um... it's, it lets you understand how to jump off your hands. You know, for whatever reason, if you need to, you know what I mean. And I think that, that will be useful for some people. I mean, the way I heard the story was like, Stephane Vigroux, was training with David Belle, and he couldn't jump over the same things that David Belle could jump over. And so he was using his hands to help him so 100% for Stephane, who, I guess, was like, the first one that did it in that in that community, it was useful for him, right? You know, and it allowed him to accomplish the same task, you know, get from here to here that his training partner was accomplishing and in his own way, so I think there's that benefit of it, it's, you know, options are never a bad thing, right. And then secondarily, there's, you know, how it benefits you, you think about if, if I not that I would ever do this, but if I said, Okay, I'm going to train one person only with jumps and one person only with catpasses, I would guess that that person would at least have a little bit more balanced muscular development than the person that is only working jumps. And so for me, that's the other aspect is like, I want people to at least at the basic level, you know, have the capacity to push in front of them, to push overhead, to push underneath them, like for dip or whatever. Same for pulling and then, same thing for their jumps and stuff like that, they should be able to jump well off either leg, off both legs, in different kinds of positions and stuff like this. It's that same idea of not really trying to worry about piling on a tonne of techniques, I want them to see these basic techniques and understand that that's actually where the all the fancy ones come from, you know what I mean? They're just combinations of foundations. Or if you take like a palm flip that, for example, it's just a backflip and a catpass put together on a wall. You know what I mean? Catpass is a foundational parkour movement, just because of its differences from the other vaults. And then, you know, backflip is not necessarily foundational parkour movement, but it's a it's a basic, if somebody's trying to do acrobatics, you know.",1733,423
18,67,interviewer,"So these kind of foundational things, you know, particularly for coaching, maybe they've kind of become this collection of things that gets passed on, because they've kind of stood the test of time a little bit. They've just proven their utility? And whether individuals adopt them or like them, or what is kind of down for them. But it's just like, I mean, maybe I think you mentioned earlier, the pareto thing, maybe it's just like their their a common collection that works for a lot of people for a lot of ways. But obviously, people are always going to have their own preferences and individuality.",478,106
18,68,participant,"Yeah exactly. No 100%. I mean, it's just like, I mean, it's like anything, right? If you're, if you want to be successful, that's such a vague thing. But there's so many ways you can do that, you know, people go to college and become doctors, some people, you know, they, they work with their hands and do this kind of stuff. You know, it's the same thing. Like, with parkour, it's exactly that, you're trying to just move from in move around in your space. And, as you said, there's these people that came before us. And they've blazed these different pathways. And it's our choice which paths we want to take and how we want to branch off from that. I think I saw that I saw a quote from Seneca recently that ties exactly into this. I wish I remember the exact quote, otherwise, but but his his plan, his idea was with stoicism, for example, you know, to take to take heed and learn from the people in our past. But that doesn't mean you need to follow the path they followed, you know, stringently. And, you know, the Bruce Lee, when I know well enough, you know, it's like, you know, take what's useful, and then discard what's useless, and it seems, you know, for you, right, there's not like, the whole thing, when one person that I just came to mind when you were mentioning, this is someone like, [name] on, I don't know where he's from, and I'm sure I butchered his name, but he is like, a disabled parkour guy. And he's a freaking beast, he's like, so good, but he moves obviously, way different, in some ways than the rest of us, because he can't literally run into things, you know what I mean, he, he does connected plyos to get into stuff, but you know, he does lots of dashes. Because that just facilitates his body movement better, but he can still, you know, catpass, he does side flips, he does backflips, all these kinds of things. And, you know, his technique is definitely going to be different than ours. And what's useful for him is not necessarily going to be useful for us, right. So, I think those those pathways is, is one of the things that makes parkour the potential to be as accessible as it is, because, you know, yeah, we have, like, all these different things you can do, but what you have to do, you know, it might change as competitions get bigger, and you know, I assume, then then that might shift of what is valued, because then the value is going to shift of just the thing to do for fun, or fitness or, you know, whatever, into sport, you know, and that's where things are going to shift. If you think of like gymnastics, from the 70s to today, they didn't do nearly as many giants, for example, where they're just spinning all the way around the bar, you know, in an extended body position. They did way more like hip circley type things and small compressed type things if we're thinking about uneven bars, you know, and, and so in the 70s, those movements were way more valuable. The uneven bars were closer, you could do different transitions. Nowadays, the uneven bars are almost far enough apart, that the people can be fully extended, you know, because that's where the sport went. So now, what is a foundational technique in the 70s could differ, you know, from what it is today in gymnastics just because of the apparatus that's changed. You know what I mean? And so the cool thing I love about Parkour is it's not technically any apparatus, but that's probably going to change, you know, as things start to progress down into this competitive route, which is, you know, it's not a bad or a good thing, it's just the thing. And so the thing that we would hope is that as wide as I perceive parkour, at least to be, that whatever snapshot, you know, a competition is of that, you know, it would hopefully get a clear enough picture that somebody can at least get an idea of, of parkour of what it can be, you know, what I mean? When you think of, you know, only seeing speed competitions, you're never gonna know, like, all the super dope stuff people can do, you know, with flips in, and all that kind of stuff. And the same thing, if you just some people, you know, bouncing around from wall to wall doing, like, the craziest tricks, you're not going to necessarily get the idea of seeing, you know, people do super, you know, long endurance lines, or the crazy descent type stuff that's happening. And so, you know, I think parkour in and of itself is such a wide discipline, that there's inevitably going to be these different competitive offshoots that already exist, right. It's only getting further that but but as a coach, at least as a coach that I want to be, I would like to, I would like people to give to give people the picture, and then they go down the path that they want to go, you know, give them the foundation and let them build whatever house they want to build on top of that foundation. I know  that was like, not a catpass related [laugh]",3770,916
18,69,interviewer,"It's all good. Just, it's great. Just to switch track slightly. How did you yourself, learn the catpass movement? Were you self taught? Or did you go to classes or watch YouTube videos?",143,33
18,70,participant,"Yeah, so I started before YouTube existed. And I was the first person in my city, in Texas that started training, like 18 years ago, or something like this, all I got to see was, you know, speed air man, and like, frickin, what is it the BBC advert and some things, you know, Yamakasi type things. And so, I taught it in a way that I mean, I did it in a way that I wouldn't teach us, but just, you know, it's like a young 13 year old kid, I was like, okay, so they're just diving headfirst, and they're pushing on the bottom, you know, the thing or whatever. So, went to a picnic table, and then just ran at it and jumped headfirst and pushed on it, and thankfully, it worked. So, you know, for that I'm grateful for but I didn't, you know, my technique 100% changed too you know, as as, as I developed it too, you know, like, I did it there. And then, you know, I definitely was like a bit of a... you know, when you do anything and you start to begin it, you can get like kind of an ego about it. Right? You know, I'm the only one training parkour, I got these, like, cool moves and stuff like that. And then I remember, I like just humbled myself, so bad once trying to do like a, you know, catpass over like a bar neck high standing with like a two metre drop. For some reason I'm like, yeah, I got this, but I'm not, at this point I'm still super early in my training. I'm not strong at all, I was like a video game kid before this. You know what I mean? So I like full on, I don't even get up, I just hit my ankles, and then I just go headfirst. And it had like, a huge fear barrier for me for years after that, like, scraped my face up and sprained my neck and my wrist and I was super embarrassed because it was like at the end of school, so everybody's heading to their buses, and they just watched me eat it super hard [laugh] But it was, it was a good thing, right? At least I was able to turn it into a good thing. But because of that, you know, I had a huge fear barrier that I then had to overcome for myself, it took me literally, like a year or a year and a half to be able to even do or commit to a catpass again, you know what I mean? And so this is I've had this, these kinds of lessons with things like the catpass, with the back tuck, where it's like, you know, the, the mental barrier is often the hardest one for somebody to overcome. And the best way to help somebody overcome this is to is to gradually introduce, you know, right, the risk or the fear or whatever it is and to just to gently touch on it until, you know, that barriers has eroded enough that it's surmountable. And and so, you know, I got really good at finding ways to, to work into stuff that I was afraid of and finding progressions, I guess I should say. That compounded with like, my first student was like a 57 year old woman who, she had no ACL, she previously broken her spine, and for some reason, she wanted to train parkour. So, you know, I was another instance where I was like, Okay, well, I think this was like, it was like, literally my first paying person for teaching. And I was like, Okay, I need to, like, I need to do this right. You know, and, and so from my own personal experience, I tried to, you know, even the young whippersnappers that are like, ready to just dive at all, at a picnic table and push off it, I think it's better to, you know, doesn't have to be as slow as I would with, you know, someone like, my first student or whatever, but to ramp up into it, you know, in a nice, nice, smooth way, gentle way, progressive way.",2670,714
18,71,interviewer,"And is that kind of understanding, and you mentioned your technique updating over time as well. Is that just from your own experience? Or has that come from talking to other people? Or any, you know, I, I've seen that you've got some coaching qualifications and stuff, anything come from any of those? Or is it all just experience and down to you?",273,63
18,72,participant,"I mean, I think the most valuable thing for my training was to go and travel and train with other peers, people have, like a similar, you know, experience level or whatever, because they, they had to solve similar problems in their own way. Which, which, then when, you know, we share ideas from there. I think it can, it can really help boost, you know, their training. And then also, I think a lot from videos, obviously, like, that's all I had in the beginning. And so, you know, I did talk with one guy, I remember, when I first started training, his name is [name], and he's kind of a jerk on the dot net forums back in the day, but for whatever reason, I decided , I got to reach out to him to help get advice. I know, he did advice for muscle ups and stuff like this, I can't remember if he gave any advice, specifically for the catpass. But I think yeah, just having an open mind and sharing and always knowing, like, even just, it was only, I guess, four years ago, or something that I had that little epiphany that was given to me from my friend, Pedro, for how I wasn't pushing that much with my cat passes. And so he was hitting this rail catpass, pretty, super easily. And I was like, struggling, and then he just, you know, gave one little tip, and I start inputting into it, and I got it, you know, quite easily. And so, you know, even just that expanded my, my, you know, technical idea of a catpass, or how to how to do it. So I think it's, you know, I think videos can help, people can help and, you know, people maybe outside of your circle was, like, at least for me, what was the most most valuable thing, right, because, you know, if you're training with a community, well, the community will start to naturally kind of, like, coalesce, you know, and there'll be a similar style or a similar thinking that happens in there, obviously, you know, outliers of that, but it's still, you know, there's a reason why people will go the Russian style or the British style, right? Because, because people were training together, and they're sharing those ideas, most of the ideas that get connected, so I think it's, it's super good, travelling, learn and share like that.",1662,410
18,73,interviewer,"Like a social exchange kind of, of ideas.",32,8
18,74,participant,"Definitely. Like, you know, like, open source, like an open source programme, like, has the potential to be super, super useful and super helpful for the community at large. And I think, you know, Parkour is kind of like, open source movement. You know, it started in a viral way. It didn't have, you know, like, a lineage like some martials arts do, where, you know, the style of martial art that you're practising is quite similar, most likely to the one that, you know, just like a language, right, that has new aspects of it, but but it's still that language. And I think parkour wasn't like this at all really. So, the way people train parkour, at least in my travelling in the US and the Middle East, you really, really see the things those communities valued, then you can utilise that and share the stuff that your community valued to, to, as a worldwide community, be stronger, you know, the more knowledgeable. I mean, that's exactly what this is right?",744,173
18,75,interviewer,"I really like that description of it as open source, I think that's a really nice way to describe it. And when you were kind of doing these exchanges, do you find that people have the fundamental idea of the catpass movement? You know, trying to focus on the catpass, but really for any movement, I guess, that's kind of remained similar? And it's, it's the, the kind of smaller parts, or the tweaks and the minor adjustments, that that change for groups? Or is it, have you found that it's like a radically different movement in some other communities?",433,100
18,76,participant,"No, I think it's quite, it's quite similar, but it's just the only real discrepancies maybe I've seen is like, how picky people are on like, how linearly your knees are going, you know, if you're a little bit to the side, or, you know, because you can, if you're pushing early enough, you can get your legs to the side and still kind of have a little bit of power, you know, when it's not, it's not like a side vault where that one arm is staying on the whole way, you know, you can kind of push and then the legs... And then there's people that, you know, will do that maybe a lot and still call it a Kong or catpass, or whatever. So, but from like, the fundamental idea of, you're running or jogging, or whatever, projecting yourself and popping off and getting a bit of lift with both hands, as you tuck, you know, even if your tuck is a little bit, you know, sideways or whatever. It's still, is like a catpass. You know what I mean? It's like, it's like, British English and English, right? They're still saying, I don't know, like I said, the examples. But.",798,204
18,77,interviewer,"Whether you're using an S or a Z in all your words, that kind of difference.",58,16
18,78,participant,"Aluminium's, aluminium, even if it's aluminium, it's the same thing.",52,10
18,79,interviewer,"And how about when it comes to like coaching techniques for the movement? Are they similar, people have like a basic idea that has kind of spread, and it's just kind of individual tweaks and stuff or do people have, again, different approaches completely?",205,44
18,80,participant,"I think, funnily enough, I've seen coaching as maybe where somebody or some people get more stringent or less, more or less flexible in what they perceive as their method, you know, is the best method for it. I couldn't say why. And I didn't think about that until just now. But I've definitely seen people be way more picky with how to teach a catpass than what is a catpass, which is a funny distinction. I never thought about that before. But yeah, so in that respect, I think I, you know, I see lots of different methods of what is the best way to prepare somebody for it. And my perspective is the best way is the way that the student gets the quickest, right. So I'm sure I saw different methods, probably each of the certifications that I took, I couldn't, you know, say it exactly. Because they all kind of blend together. But for me, the benefit is in not, you know, not just taking one tool, you know, and using it for everything is trying to have as many different tools as I can for the job, you know.",783,194
18,81,interviewer,"I'm curious about the certifications, as you mentioned them, because I have some experience with some of these, but not not all of the ones that you do. Is it... Do they teach how to teach specific movements? Or is it more general coaching techniques? Have you ever actually been taught?, like, this is how you teach a catpass? Or is it more just that it's assumed from you being an experienced parkour practitioner, you know how to do it, and there's more general coaching skills being taught.",388,88
18,82,participant,"I think from observing, the more or the less experienced students, there's, they definitely what's it called, give a little bit more progressions and attention for the technical stuff, depending on the group because I, I, like I said, I did my certifications, for thinking for ADAPT, for example, but I sat in on a couple of different ADAPT ones where I wasn't teaching, I was just observing and helping out, I was in town or whatever. And then you would see, okay, maybe they needed more help. So they would give a quick tip, but for me, I think the biggest focus was, I mean, it's different for each one, for the ADAPT one, I would say, at least the level one was like making sure that you can at least do some of the basic movements and know some basic coaching stuff. I can't recall there being specific, you know, because there's, there's a lot of material to cover, right and, and they do it just a weekend, most of, all these certs were like that. And the Parkour EDU one, for example, the they did, they were mostly focused on the teaching, which I liked, they weren't that fussed as ADAPT is on like, you know, making you do a bunch of stuff, which is cool. I enjoyed that. But I understand, you know, that's not directly applicable necessarily to coaching as the actual activity. I understand trying to keep the spirit or whatever. But, for example, in the Parkour EDU, that I took the coaches, they, they were kind of known for their things like one was known for climb ups, and the other was known for their rolls and falls. So the other than kind of the general vaults and movements type stuff and some coaching stuff, those techniques we did specifically focus on for our own progression and for helping others progress. And then, the APK one was so long ago that it's a bit hard for me to remember, but I think I had a similar impression. But I also felt that was a bit that was a bit just more of a debate, because there was the same idea, like I was mentioning, where like, Okay, this is how you should teach this movement. And someone's like, no, this is how you should teach this, right? Just devolved into kind of like a bit of a pissing contest, you know what I mean, at certain points. So I think, it's there. I mean, for example, I was gonna, if I can, I was gonna screen share with you, I have a website that I'm working on. And we have like a catpass page, for example.",1847,453
18,83,interviewer,"I actually had a look at it after you filled in the form. Not in great detail yet. But I did check it out as ah I need to, I need to look around. I mean, it's so it's kind of my next question is, you know, should that stuff be in coaching certifications? Or do you think it should be down to people learning just from experience, how to teach movement? I know it's quite a loaded question [laugh]",302,80
18,84,participant,"No, I mean, as far as coaching certifications go, I, I understand them as like, as a necessary evil, you know, if you want to say that. And one thing that I think [name] said during one of the ADAPT certs that I was sitting in on was like, certification doesn't mean you're good, it just means you're not like, bad, you know, you're above a certain level of bad, but it's acceptable, or something, he probably said it better than that. But I mean, in my opinion, something like an apprenticeship is way more applicable to all you know, it's probably most things honestly, if you're going to be teaching it, you know, if you think of a teacher in school, how much schooling do they have to do for their subjects and stuff like that before they're teaching, you know what I mean? But you know, you can go to a frickin weekend parkour certification or a weekend CrossFit certification. And, and then you're teaching this stuff to people, and this is stuff that could conceivably debilitate them for the entirety of their lives, if they are trying to do a WoD, and they don't have the good technique, but you have 30 students, you know, doing that, or, you know, you go to teach a catpass. But you're used to you, you know, I've had this with some teachers that I've trained, where they, they were aware enough and acknowledged, like, I kind of forgot how I taught, you know, learned this thing for myself, because I've been doing it so long. I'm just, I just do it now. And, you know, they forget that struggle, right. And so, if you're not, you know, maybe if you are just training with yourself and peers, you, you get a little bit of a warped sense of what a human is capable of, you know what I mean? And so I think, I think it's important to give, to not force somebody to take a certain way, but to give people options and possibilities, right? If we think of like the the pareto principle thing again, it's like, what are the most likely things, bad things to happen for a catpass? You know what I mean? Like shinning, hitting your knee, you know, landing on your head, that's like the worst thing so what things can we do to mitigate that possibility while learning the catpass. Okay, lower the fall risk, doing it on the ground. Okay, still keep a low fall risk, but allow them to work on a more normal entry, you know, on a picnic tables or a long object, you know, okay, they can't comfortably pop on like catpass on top of the obstacles to get to their feet. So they don't have that as a bailing mechanism, you know what I mean? And the secondary thing that doing that catpass on top helps with this, it helps them get their chest up, which can give a little bit more flexibility, if they did clip their knee, or their shin, you know what I mean? Like, these days, if I clip my knee, I'm not usually landing on my head, you know what I mean? I'm, I'll clip that knee, and I can make that knee light enough that you know, like it hits and then I am able still to get my chest up and get my other leg to the ground. Right. So it's like, I think it's more like these are the important things is like how to just mitigate risk in the technique that you're doing. And then how you do that is like up to you, you know, any of the people that I've taught as students, for parkour, or teachers for parkour, it's like, I have these ideas or whatever that I've developed, and I'm happy to get their, you know, input as well. But the goal, first and foremost is for them to be safe. And then second is to like, the way that works is the way that works, right? I said, I don't want anybody to be like a Jeremy parkour robot, or, you know, Jeremy, parkour robot teacher or whatever, because they're not going to understand intrinsically how to get that message across. And I think the authenticity is invaluable when it comes to, to, you know, learning something, or passing on something, or, or really enjoying something, you know, when you're doing it, when you when you can learn to do it for that intrinsic feeling of you just enjoy it. I think that has that benefit, right. And so I think, especially for something like, back to the catpass, as it being a potentially risky move compared to some other moves, though, that being said, you know, people wreck themselves bad on step vaults, you know what I mean? So it's like, who knows, you know, you can't, with 100% certainty, say, any move is more dangerous than the other, but this one has more potential for danger. Therefore, it's important, I think, to find ways to, to mitigate that risk, first and foremost, and then give as many different options, you know, as you can, for example, that like, squat on movement, where you know, your hands are together and your feet on the outside, I don't use that movement that much to teach people to catpass. But I know the Yamak, used it a lot when we were, I was doing some classes with them. And I have found it useful for for students that just have trouble getting those knees up, you know what I mean? And they are really uncomfortable to squat with their legs together, because they're at least working the hip flexors, to drive those knees up and get that push. And then one day, you know, that could conceivably aid them in the catpass. So it's like, I've done this progression for in my, in the last year and a half, I think two or three students, you know what I mean, but that doesn't mean it's not useful. It was super useful to them. Right. And I wouldn't have known that progression unless it was shown to me by another person, you know, and then I wouldn't have tried it for myself, you know, I wouldn't have known it was useful unless I kind of kept it and looked for what the student needed, right? Oh, man, they can't bring their knees up, or they can't keep their feet together the squat, you know, it's just really for uncomfortable them. Okay. Well, how do I get them to at least do a catpass-like thing, symmetrical push, knees tucking in, you know, this move? It's like, you know, it's like, you're building like an encyclopaedia, right. I mean, that's what makes a good coach is someone that has that experience, and, you know, has had hundreds of people as a guinea pig, in addition to hopefully themselves as a guinea pig and their other peers, as you know, it's this open source thing that we're trying to talk about, like, what's the, what's the solution? Right? After, after that, or before that it's just, is this safe? You know, is this the safest way? Are we making it, you know, as safe as it can be? And I'm talking about explicitly for beginners, obviously, you know, because I think the thing that I'd like to transfer into it, again, is like, if they're, if they're reliant on you as their coach, then they're not going to be able to think for themselves and understand like, Okay, this is too much for me, this is not too much for me. And so, in the beginning, they have no idea what the heck they can do. So it's your job to help them figure that out, and then, and then they can do whatever the heck they want with the catpass. You know, they can go for some sketchy shit. And you can say, okay, like, was that a good idea? You know, you're like, Okay, but now you you learn this or whatever and ideally, ideally, we're going to avoid that as much as possible. Right? You know, my, one of my other the guy that did the APK cert, actually, you know, he was he said he was the kind of person that you know, if somebody told you the burner was hot, he just had to see, you know. So, you know, there's the people that we were all probably a combination of it, you know, someone tells you the burner is hot, and you believe them, you're like, cool. And then someone tells you it's hot. You're like, ehh, okay, yeah. And, and with something like parkour, and some of the higher risk things, ideally, you want them to learn the first way. But we learn, you know, lessons. Sorry, I talked a lot there.",6056,1502
18,85,interviewer,"No, it's great. I am, I'm kind of just a tiny bit aware the time as well, so I just... Is there... We've covered a lot of the points I'd like to get through, which is great. Is there anything about the movement that you're curious about for yourself, or that you wish, you would like to know more about? Just for yourself? And I always like to say to people as well, it's fine if the answer's no.",293,79
18,86,participant,"I mean, I would just be interested... So I had a funny instance, just a couple months ago, where it was a brand new student, but he was like, super, just a really natural mover, and he got the catpass like, first try and super easy. And me and one of the other, just normal community guys were trying this large catpass to cat with a bit of a high take off, you know, and I was like doing my dip and running and all this kind of stuff and having a little bit of trouble to get to it, you know. And this kid goes for it. And he gets super close, just trying it, you know what I mean? And so then I understood at that moment that, at that speed is kind of what I was talking about the beginning that like my dip was actually hindering my technique, because it was creating a longer transfer time from my run into my catpass. You know, and so and then I, you know, took that lesson from this complete newbie, just by watching him. And I got it, you know that next try. And so I'm interested, I would really be interested in knowing a little bit more logically of like, how the technique changes through the different speeds, you know what I mean, if you look like someone like [name], like, he can frickin fly, you know what I mean? And I think it's in part with how comfortable he is with his acceleration into the catpass. And then that transference of it, and I think that's like, for me, that's my least practised part, you know, would be maximal effort running into catpass. And then, because it's high risk, and then secondarily would be, would probably be similar application, but to rails, you know, what I mean? Like seeing how, how the technique changes, as it's applied to rails, like, at what point you know, do do people always try and do this when they're going to a rail? Is there a certain point where they'll commit to this, because it's riskier, but maybe it can give them some more power. I've felt that a little bit on like, some fatter rails before, or some more odd shaped rails where it felt riskier to do it, but I felt like if I wanted to get that distance, I had to, you know, had to do it that way.",1630,412
18,87,interviewer,"So, I mean, with rails, is it because you can't get the hand flat? It kind of changes how you can do that push, we were talking about?",100,28
18,88,participant,"Yeah, I think so. You know, it's like you, it's like you're trying to do a catpass but your fingers are cut off, right? You don't have the, that's the flexor and the whole follow through to, to help connect with everything. So I would love like some, you know, kind of like what you're doing but like with, with, I would I wish there was like a nice way to like biomechanically analyse, like what each person's, you know, doing at different speeds. And then, you know, be able to amalgamate that into some kind of approximation of like, how these people are transferring their movements, but to me, I think the best way to do that is like watching it and also talking with people, you know, I haven't, I haven't, for example, heard many people, not that I've talked to many, not as many as you for sure about the catpass, about, like, you know, when they dip, do they always dip, at what speed do they stop dipping, you know, what I mean? And I that was, you know, something that I realised in the past month that I was like, okay, sometimes I'm overly reliant on this dip, and it's hurting me. And I'd be really interested for for some more aware, you know, practitioners that you know, are also competent in something like the catpass to, to weigh in on, like, how the technique changes at their speed, and yeah, how the technique changes for them on rails or rails at speed things like this. I think that's, that's interesting for me, because it's like, it's something more towards the advanced and of what you can do, or what you're trying to do with a catpass. You know, and I think, you know, you go to YouTube, and there's a thousand beginner tutorials on catpass. And everybody can, you know, teach you the basics of one, but what is, you know, what's getting somebody from their plateau, you know, what I mean? Like plateau in a catpass, to then get that more, more power and distance.",1449,352
18,89,interviewer,"Is that... so is kind of distance something that is, like, that's what you kind of progress towards, with the kong, like increasing the distance off the back end of the vault?",135,32
18,90,participant,"For me, I think so, I love, I like the exit distance feeling. I mean, I see, obviously, people do the entry distance too, which is cool. But for me, it's like hard on the wrist, I would rather double, you know, if I had that opportunity. But I think one of the things that the catpass does that feels unique to me is that feeling of like literally jumping off your hands and getting a tonne of power and being able to kind of fly out of it. So I think that's definitely one of the places it excels and I'm, it feels super cool, it's a lot of fun to do, so it's something that I definitely prioritise. And that's something that I think, is only possible once you start getting competent enough for the movement, you know, what I mean? Like, take the percentage of people, you know, I imagine if you did a statistics of who can do a catpass in the world, and then who can do a catpass level to precision seven feet or something like that, you know, what I mean? The numbers probably go way down from there. And then there's people like [name] are doing, like ten foot or something level precisions. And there's some other people that are doing that, too. And it's like, you know, what's, obviously I'm sure there's like a genetic element, but I'm sure there's also a technical element, you know, even myself, my, my maximum that I did, I think was two and a half metres level. And when I, it was just interesting, from my first attempt at it, it seemed impossible. After 45 minutes of attempts, I barely got it, you knot what I mean? And, and I wasn't present enough in that moment to understand as much what it was other than maybe just getting less reliant on this, what's it called this dip, and, and more, you know, comfortable just sprinting as hard as I could at, at the object, making sure I accelerate at the end, that kind of stuff. But I'm super interested in these kinds of things. Obviously, there's no market for it, necessarily. But, you know, how are people you know, getting, you know, how are people progressing into these level lache pres into these big, you know, catpasses in these catpass rails into the, you know, these kind of more advanced parkour movements, you see, you know, even people, at least I think the progressions on stuff like side flips precision, you know, even that's becoming like a basic move, for example, but I'm interested in seeing the methods of like, you know, elite parkour people, for some of these, you know, these foundational moves that they're pushing way further than other people. But I think it's a super niche thing, right? Who's gonna [unclear]",2004,479
18,91,interviewer,"Hopefully me in a couple years, who knows? Okay. Is there anything else that kind of popped into your head or you've thought of at any point that we didn't get to, or anything else you'd like to add?",153,39
18,92,participant,Could I show you the catpass page real quick that I have on explore parkour?,61,15
18,93,interviewer,"Yeah. Is that, is there something in there that is, you want to include in the study, or is it-",71,20
18,94,participant,"It's more just a method thing, I guess, if I look at it real quick. It's like, you still hear me, right?",75,22
18,95,interviewer,"Yeah, the only thing I'm thinking is if I transcribe this, I'm not able to transcribe the images. That's all. But I'm happy to talk about it.",106,27
18,96,participant,I can just talk about it a bit.,23,8
18,97,interviewer,Sure.,4,1
18,98,participant,"One of the things that we're trying to do with it is, is kind of similar to, what's it called , this is what I is talking about giving different paths right. So, in it, we we show the movement itself, we also break up the movement into the common problems that can happen, generally what we, me and my friend have seen of the common problems would happen usually in the takeoff, or in the middle portion of the of the movement. And so-",337,84
18,99,interviewer,"I'm sorry to interrupt, but it hasn't come up my screen. I don't know if your screen shared yet.",72,19
18,100,participant,I don't think I did it right. Let's try that again. Can you give me permission to share? I think that's what it is.,85,24
18,101,interviewer,"Ah. Ah, yep, there we go. Should be able to now.",33,11
18,102,participant,"Perfect. Okay, can you see what's happening? Okay, so, here we have like, the different movement, pieces of it, for example, just the different angles that you can, you know, see the catpass happening, it gets a little bit slow, but you kind of get the idea, landing shot, hand shot, and then we have even sequencing for it. So it kind of talks through the, the basic kind of sequence of the movement, as you're going through, we have, we break up these problems again. So you know, people maybe have problems in the takeoff, this one taking off too close, you know, we explained why this might happen, then we have problems in the middle, why you might have some issues with that movement, and you can use a little side by side analysis type deal, to look at it, obviously it's not finished yet. But then from there, you know, we go into different progressions that you can be used in there. And they're, they're just kind of there, there'll be little explanations of, you know, what it can help with at the bottom of it, or whatever, you know, it's just the gifs, but you can see different things that, you know, might help you with the movement. See if this one works as well. Yeah. And so you see, that's helping with that snap down, and what you would do for like, the, you know, Kong Precision, and this is like, harder, probably, then, you know, when you're trying to actually do the catpass. So, some of these things are more like to give you a surplus of ability for when you're trying to do that movement, right. And then after progressions, the last kind of thing that last two things that we have are the what we call a modifier, so it's ways that you can alter the movement to, you know, to play with it. So this is a combination, you're mixing the catpass with the landing of a jump, you know, what I mean? You're doing it on, you know, a bar, how that changes the technique, just like how we explained or, if you're trying to do it on, you know, trying to get that exit distance instead of the, what's it called the entry distance. Another modifier that we would potentially put here would be like that palm flip that I was talking about, since you're doing that to kong. And then from there, this one I don't think is organised yet. But then the last thing would be like different movements that, you know, help you with it. So in like the tuck up, which is, you know, you driving both your knees in, and then the push up and variations of that. So that kind of goal is to break it down for students in this kind of way, if that makes sense.",1961,485
18,103,interviewer,"Yeah. I really like that. And I like the kind of grouping of things as, you know, common problems and stuff, rather than perhaps focusing on like, this is the way you should do the movement. It's like, these are the various things that we've noticed people commonly have issues with.",222,51
18,104,participant,"Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's, that's 100%. Because we're, you know, especially if this is aiming to be like, we're kind of trying to be like an online parkour encyclopaedia. It's like, the resource I wish I had, you know. And, and, and so we have to kind of go through from when I was teaching, and from, you know, our own experience, what things can help, and you can see, you know, even then, it's not in this one exactly. But we have like in our cat crawl one. It talks about, like, a common problem is to, you know, when you're doing the cat crawl, to not move contralaterally, but to move, you know, both hands at the same time. And then we, you know, express in it that, yeah, this is a common problem for the catpass. But this also is a move in and of itself. You know what I mean? And as long as it's not hurting you, this thing is, had something valuable too, and the point is that you're choosing to do the move instead of letting your habit make you do the ipsilateral movement versus the contralateral if we take the cat crawl for example.",795,202
18,105,interviewer,"It's kind of one of the things I'm curious about with this study is, you know, you have something like that where you have these modifiers, for example, you mentioned you have things like the different takeoffs, the different landings, dive kong, double Kong, stuff like that. But they're all still kind of within that catpass family, is that where it comes down to that kind of fundamental pattern of movement, you're talking about like that, hands, hands, jumping off the obstacle, almost like diving onto that. That's the kind of core it?",427,93
18,106,participant,"Yeah no, I think so. Because, I mean, eventually, I would love to, like, so I made this website with zero, well I'm using [unclear] or whatever. So it's not like having to do hard coding or anything like that, anyway, but zero kind of web design experience and stuff. And one of the main things I'm, other things I want to try and help show is these kind of like, familial connections, coordination wise with these different movements. So like, you know, you were saying this catpass archetype, how it fits into dive catpasses, or exit distance and how the technique changes, or the palm flip or the pop on top and being ready to plyo after or, let's see another one, or, you know, the one on the ground, because that's a different move in and of itself too. And, and so, seeing these, or the burpee, which is like, like, I would say, is the exercise version that's closest to like a catpass, you know, what I mean, or the top out for a climb up, you know, all these things, they share this kind of cat pass archetype. And then from that there's like these related moves, you know, if we take the, if we take the, the catpass precision, it's just the entry of, the entry of a catpass, the middle of a catpass, and then kind of the middle slash end of a precision jump and the end of a precision jump. So my theory is that by helping someone get really comfortable with so, if there's five parts to catpass precision, you know, if you can help them, if they can learn two of those parts, by learning the catpass, and the other two of those parts by learning the precision, then they'll only technically have one completely new thing to do, neurologically, to understand, to link a catpass and a precision together. And so it's all just my theory, or whatever, but this is kind of the way I'm trying to, I would love to eventually visually be able to describe and show these, like, you know, these roots, these branches, these constellation, connections, however, you want to say, you know, what it means, of how each movement is related and can help each other because for me, the thing that I kind of go to with teaching somebody movement is like, how close is it to their fear zone, you know, there's their comfort zone, their work zone and then their fears zone, if you can practice four of the five parts of a new move in a way that is in their work zone or their comfort zone, then, without even trying that move, it's invariably going to shift further from the fear zone into that comfort zone, as long as they didn't have a prior negative experience with it, you know, I do this a lot with my, my backflips, I have a sequence sequence of teaching that I'm really happy with and I get probably 80% of the people doing a backflip on their first day of the class, just because it's getting real comfortable with each piece of the backflip. And then after the three pieces of the backflip are understood, the only new addition is connecting, you know, the first and the second piece so there's that new part and there's the second and the third piece there's that new part of them and so they've already done three fifths of the movement and then just have to put it all together you know.",2475,598
18,107,interviewer,"Is that, the stuff you just showed me? Is that on the website already? Or is that to be published?",75,20
18,108,participant,"This one is not published just yet but there's there's some basic stuff for, right now I'm working on a games page and as you know I'm going to Dubai, I'll be working a lot more there, not on the website sadly but I'll be trying to get stuff added, the thing is my friend is Portuguese, is Brazilian and I'm English and so he has been, had a little bit more time to add some stuff but he's also doing the translations in Portuguese so if you write something in English I usually go over to edit it you know what I mean? And then post it up so that's kind of the thing we're just waiting on right now but but if you're interested I can give you the, I have your email I can give you like a membership so you can look through through it all and see as we start to add new stuff.",598,159
18,109,interviewer,"Yeah, I mean, whenever it's whenever it's available if, I don't know if I can like follow follow you on Twitter or something just to be notified or if you would kindly drop me an email or something, just, that'd be, I'd be really interested in looking through that once it's available. Cool. Okay.",229,54
18,110,participant,"Sorry, we went long this time.",23,6
18,111,interviewer,"It's all good. Yeah, it's been great. Really, really useful. Yeah, if, again, if there's anything else you want to add, please feel free otherwise, I think I think I'm happy and we can, we can wrap up.",148,38
18,112,participant,"I'd say just the only thing just to not beat a dead horse or whatever, it's just the thing, that's the thing that I'm always trying to do with with the catpass, especially as it's slightly more here in this movement for people, right, is to, to psychologically make it more attainable first, while you know, building it up physically if they as long as they have the physical ability right. For them to psychologically achieve a little bit before they're having to achieve it in the real world. Right. And so it's through these visualisations and progressions, that they're completing the movement in more comfortable ways that they then can start to, you know, by doing a catpass a tonne of times on a picnic table, and clearing their hands, they're invariably catpassing over an obstacle already. That's, you know, whatever the length of the distance that clearly. So I think this is a huge piece, and you see people doing it already, intuitively, you know, what I mean, but I think this is a, this is something worth talking about for, for new coaches, for newer practitioners and stuff like that, that, you know, because for every person that I've seen, take a movement and break it down beautifully, and progress it nicely. You know, you have how many people say just do it, jump higher, push harder, you know, and it's like, this is a mindset that I don't think is the most applicable or the most sustainable in the teaching aspect.",1130,255
18,113,interviewer,"It's, is there, just to almost play devil's advocate. Is there any element of that in the kong vault though? You know, it is a dive, there is a slight component of commitment. You know, I wouldn't ever say, just do it. But yeah, there is an element of that first one, you kind of got to commit, right?",226,59
18,114,participant,"Yeah, for sure. I definitely agree. I think it's like that being said, it's like, it's like kick starting, not kick starting. It's like push starting a car. Right? You want, maybe, maybe it'll never, you know, the catpass won't be, okay, you just got to take the brakes off, you know, and you're already coasting downhill and do the movement. But, you know, you're trying to make that angle that they have to push that dang car, before they can kickstart it less and less, because at first, you know, they're like, trying to kick, you know, they're trying to push start a car up a hill, and instead, they're just gonna get run over by the car, right? And so how, how can we make that push that they they have to commit? You're right, it's a, it's a dynamic movement, there's no, you know, unless you're hella strong, there's no like freezing halfway. You know, you have to let go, you have to be completely in the air at a certain point of the movement, which you have to do for lots of parkour stuff. So they do eventually, yeah, have to just do it. But I think the, you know, there's, there's still closer that people can get to that before and to the comfortable idea that before they're just hucking it, you know what I mean? But, I mean, I learned it by hucking it, right. And there's people that still do and it's fine. So, you know, it's, it's finding out what works for them. Right. And I definitely, that kid that in, that kid that unconsciously, subconsciously, didn't even try, but he showed me a better technique. You know, I didn't teach him a catpass. I showed him the catpass. I gave him one or two tips. He did it first try. I mean, I've had students where they've been working on their catpass for months, you know what I mean? And sometimes it's physical barriers. Sometimes it's mental barriers, right. And and so definitely not talking trash about the just do it version, but I find it used more often than it's useful.",1467,361
18,115,interviewer,"You can kind of progress people to a point where, just do it is kind of the appropriate advice rather than being like, just do it, and it's dangerous advice.",123,30
18,116,participant,"Exactly. My last experience with this exact thing where I'm telling the person just to do it is I've been working backflips with a lady for six months att least. Then she's every time she's been asking like, you know, she's like, okay, so okay to do this with my arms, I don't need to do this. I'm like, you're doing the backflip for six months, you're good. Now you're just getting inside your head too much. You know what I mean? You need to know like, okay, you're doing a backflip, and then commit to it. And then yeah, just do it. Because at this stage, her, you know, the neural pathways are more connected, she knows what to do with the arms, what you know, then the knees come up, what happens after the knees? And yeah, there's a certain stage where like, we can get in our own way mentally, right? If you look at anything, right, anybody that's a master of something. When they're learning that thing, their brain is super, super active, as they've mastered it, the brain is less active, because it's more in the subconscious mind that's making it happen. And so at a certain point, with this, I think that's exactly what you got to do. I mean, I know, I don't often think about how I'm doing the catpass I just think do a catpass, at this stage. And so I think it's it's valuable and important to do that. But there's a time and a place, right. And you got to be kind of intuitive and empathic to understand at what point is that doing good or more harm than good, right.",1126,282
18,117,interviewer,"All right. I think I'm going to stop us there [laugh] Otherwise, it's going to be a massive transcription. It's great. I really appreciate it. And I appreciate your time, but yeah, unless there's anything else I think, I think I'll stop the recording.",192,44
18,118,participant,Nah I think I'm done [laugh],20,6
19,1,interviewer,"There we go. So as... Yeah, as the information sheet said, Really, I'm just looking to talk to parkour coaches, about the Kong vault. Because I'm interested in how we've come to understand it in our sport as it's kind of spread around and how people learnt it, and how people coach it to other people as well. Considering that we kind of have this deregulated sport that doesn't have a central organisation or rulebook or something like that. So we're kind of seeing how these things have spread. But I guess the first thing to kind of check then is, is the term Kong vault familiar to you? Is that the terminology you use for the movement?",501,118
19,2,participant,"Yeah, like most of the time, but through the course of the time, I, I think that I came across, like many or much more variations of the name, but most the time I use just the kong, because I guess it's the most common one. And it's just very simple.",189,51
19,3,interviewer,Great. And how would you describe the movement?,38,8
19,4,participant,"So basically, is it's really similar to the one in gymnastics through the obstacle, but I don't know the name of it in gymnastics. So I know the Slovak name, but I'm not sure in English. So this is the problem. But we had to move on how we can how would I describe in different way? So, yeah, if it is vaults, it's vaults, it's in that category of moves. Like, it is much more different to the climbing stuff and all the things, and in probably, in comparison to the most of the other vaults, it's, you jump off from two feet at the same time, goes like speed, dash, and all of this are from the one. So I guess the biggest difference, I would say?",491,129
19,5,interviewer,So you mentioned it's part of like a group of vaults?,41,11
19,6,participant,Yeah.,4,1
19,7,interviewer,What what kind of obstacles might they be used on? Or what might they be used for?,64,17
19,8,participant,"And these are good questions, actually. Because I don't think that I, I casually think about these things. I don't know, it's it's really universal, I would say, because most of the time you can you can use it... in a sense, there are lots of variations of Kong, you can you can use it in different ways on different materials, obstacles, rails, walls, I don't know, I used to do those in the school, through the desks [laugh] when I started, so I guess you can almost anywhere, because even you can do drops, like from the same level dropping by Kong on to the low level. So I guess I don't know. I've already seen lots of stuff.",478,120
19,9,interviewer,"Are there any that are more common, or something it's used for like a lot?",57,15
19,10,participant,"Maybe a diving Kong? Or is it's, it's really, really good. And in order to, in order to overcome a longer obstacle, right? Because it's just more practical in that sense, that you throw yourself out there and, and you can manage it, in a way that you overcome that obstacle.",210,51
19,11,interviewer,"And if you were going to, like, how would you describe the movement, like what does it look like? What, are there anything about it that when someone you know is doing parkour, say you're watching someone do a kong? How do you know that they've done a kong versus another vault, like what what kind of makes it look like a kong?",255,63
19,12,participant,"So there, there's that symmetry that both hands, place on the obstacle at the same time. And you push from the obstacle by both hands, to just try to centre yourself in a way that you lands safely so, and it does, I don't know, it just has its, you know, that essence, that uniqueness that you just know that it is a kong [laugh]",251,65
19,13,interviewer,"It's it's one of the things that I'm curious about, because, like I said at the start, there's no like rulebook that says, This is what a Kong is. So I'm really curious how people define it for themselves. You know, particularly if you're coaching, you kind of have to say, well, we I'm going to teach you how to do this movement. So what is it that you teach to them? You know, does that make sense?",302,78
19,14,participant,"Yeah, I know, what you're trying to, like, what point are trying to make. So basically, this, anytime you teach anything, you can show it straight away. And it's, it's just so clear, then. So you don't have to be so I would say, like, good with your wording, in that sense. But I think most of the time I teach basically anything, but even with the Kong is that I try to point the, those specific points of the move. So there's a there's a jump off, there's a, the actual wall. So you jump on your hands first, and then you push from that, and there's a landing. And what sorts of things that you need to think about through the whole process. So like to have, you know, just that, that position when you...",531,137
19,15,interviewer,"Yeah, I mean, I know it's difficult, because obviously, when you're coaching normally you can demonstrate, right? Because I need to put this into text, I kind of need something in words [laugh]",150,33
19,16,participant,[laugh] This is a struggle now. Yeah.,27,7
19,17,interviewer,"And I just want to point out as well, you know, it popped into my head, it's okay if, how can I put this, if, like, you don't have like an answer to something. So if I say like, what defines a Kong, and you're like, well, I don't know, it just is.",177,53
19,18,participant,"I'm just trying to, like, it's part of the, part of the answer is actually me thinking out loud, you know, so I'm trying to make something but maybe it can fail in the process [laugh] So there's the thing.",154,40
19,19,interviewer,"And I found it interesting in that, that you kind of described about the points you try and talk people through when you're coaching with them. Can you give me a bit more detail about some of those points? Are there like, things that you if you say, I'm going to teach a Kong in a, in a class or something, you know, the things you think about teaching?",274,69
19,20,participant,"Maybe that's methodology is just try to break that complex thing into simpler pieces. So, so I know that I need to focus on the jump off then on the hands then on the landing, then we can, from that point, then we can try to, like, fix some of the details. Because then, most of the time, when we, when we go through these things, with the students with the children, or anybody, there's something like, there are there going to be mistakes, and I just try to watch and, and go through, go through them in the process.",398,100
19,21,interviewer,"I mean, it would be quite good. If if we could go through maybe those you know, you describe takeoff, hands on the obstacle and landing. Maybe if we go through each of those, that would be really, really helpful. So with the takeoff are there, are there certain ways to take off for the movement or...?",233,57
19,22,participant,"Okay, so we can just go as as I will teach you basically, yeah. So like the first move for me or the first essential thing for the Kong is that takeoff from the both feet, from in the same time. And, and there's that split take off, that is being done, and it's it's just a hard move. Many times for, for the beginners because because when you see that move are being done from the from the splits take off, they don't see it in that way, they just see that the one foot is in the air bit earlier than the other one. So they just think that it is actually from the one foot but it's not like that at all. I think and I teach that the technique, it's, it's not about that, so we just tried to, like a simple exercise, like stepping from the one foot to both, and then just jump in the air, like vertical jump. And to memorise that and to optimise it, then we can use it in, in that in the technique. So yeah, there's a first thing. Then, most of the time, it's kind of a simple thing to go through a side vault or two hander, if you know what I mean. And because it's a similar thing, but there's not that, so there's, that's another difference between Kong and other things, and especially with with this side vault is that your legs go through the space that you have between your hands. And sometimes it is just like changing the side vault into the Kong vault, because it's basically almost the same. But the difference is just in the hands position and the legs position. So, so most, many times I, I just pointed out that it's really similar to that, they all, all they need to do is just to make it like a straight line. So they don't position themselves diagonally, or something like that. And then we try to do some exercises, to, to emphasise that pushing motion from the both hands. And then with there will be a monkey plant or we call it like then. So when you use a kong, but just to jump on the wall, and stop on that level. Because this is basically a same same thing as Kong, but you just don't finish the vault, basically. Or it is a Kong in some sense. But there's don't, that there's not that feeling or that fear that you that you stumble over the obstacle, and you fall. So it's really good for the beginners to just try to, to thrust the obstacle a bit more, if they if they actually, if they find out that they can jump on, and then jump over that. There will be another one. I mean, landing is just as much as most of the time it's not a problem because landing is, it's not a specific technique. It's just for me, it's like and habit, you know, to be suggestion to go on to to some to, not to fall, basically [laugh] That's the thing, I don't know what else... then I would just make the the points about the individual like because some sometimes there's a problem that they don't believe that they can push from the obstacle. So they tried to compensate it by lifting just one hand. So maybe they need to return to that pushing motion and try those monkey plants a bit more. Or there's a problem with a takeoff that they try to take off from the one foot so we need to work on that again. So yeah, it's this process of watching and trying again, doing it repeatedly.",2449,626
19,23,interviewer,"I, I made a few notes as you went through that. So just to kind of go back to the take off for a second. So when you say the split foot takeoff. So, it's kind of similar to a lot of what I've heard from other people, which is, you know, people start out taking off both feet at the same time, kind of like a jump.",234,68
19,24,participant,Yeah.,4,1
19,25,interviewer,But then you transition into taking off from split feet. ,46,10
19,26,participant,Yeah.,4,1
19,27,interviewer,"But you're saying it's not, it's not like you're just running and you just keep running, it still kind of goes into like, you're still jumping off two feet, just the feet are split, is that right?",149,37
19,28,participant,"Yeah, I understand it in that way. It's just smoother in that way. Because you, you don't have that impact by jumping on the both feet in this in the same time. Because you can like, that energy is is going a bit smoother in that way. But that that pushing motion in your legs, I guess is it would be probably more in the in the front leg, because it's up front but, it's like the pushing is actually is in the same time with both feet. So that's, that's how I understand it.",362,95
19,29,interviewer,So it just feels like a smoother transition-,36,8
19,30,participant,"Yeah, yeah.",8,2
19,31,interviewer,-Into the rest of the movement.,24,6
19,32,participant,"That's basically the thing. So the split take off is, yeah, it's just as you said, it is a smoother transition from the running to actually jumping. Yeah.",119,28
19,33,interviewer,Does that difference affect the rest of the movement? Does it make a difference to how you perform the rest of the kong? Or is it just a nicer take off?,119,31
19,34,participant,"I mean, it just, is that one detail that when you master it, you just can you just can jump longer distances. Because it's, it doesn't take you that speed from from from running through to the obstacle. Yeah.",161,39
19,35,interviewer,So it'll lets you maintain your speed better.,36,8
19,36,participant,Yeah. Yeah that's the thing.,21,5
19,37,interviewer,"To go further in the vault. Okay. And then, so, you mentioned the two hander? Did I get that right?",74,20
19,38,participant,"Yeah. It's, is the same thing, like so many variations of the name, so I just use whatever one.",71,19
19,39,interviewer,"I've heard, I've heard that. I wasn't familiar with it before. But I've heard that from a few other people in the in these interviews. So is that essentially you're doing a kong bt you're allowing the legs to come around the side a bit more rather than staying straight between the hands? Is that right?",236,56
19,40,participant,"Yeah, it, yeah, we can, like we can look at it from the perspective of Kong or the side vault. So if we're talking about side vault, it's basically Kong but it's taking the legs around and if if you're talking around, the other way around, so Kong is basically side vault but you are straight.",225,56
19,41,interviewer,"Okay. So the kind of basic pattern of hands only on the obstacle, and I guess knees coming to chest to kind of tuck you up.",95,26
19,42,participant,Yeah.,4,1
19,43,interviewer,"And then passing over the obstacle. It's just whether you're kind of passing sideways or straightforward, right.",91,17
19,44,participant,"Yeah, that's it.",11,3
19,45,interviewer,"Okay. And when you talked about pushing on the obstacle as well, is that to create space on top of the obstacle for the legs to come through?",111,28
19,46,participant,"Yeah, that's the point of the motion because if you let your hands all the way all the time in the place, you are going to stumble and fall so okay, you need to do that, yeah.",133,37
19,47,interviewer,So it's more about just kind of clearing the obstacle and having enough space to do that kind of pushing yourself away from it.,102,24
19,48,participant,"Yeah, exactly.",11,2
19,49,interviewer,"How about, does pushing on the obstacle contribute to distance or anything like that? I know some people have described that to me. Or do you find it's just to create that space?",141,33
19,50,participant,"I think that in dive Kongs and, and regular ones, it's just to clear this space just to make you go through but in double Kong, the first takeoff, the hands actually help you to to make it longer so far, and I'm not sure about kong to precision, how much it affects the actual distance or efficiency of the vault, but but most of the time and the main function, I would say that it is to make the space for you.",318,83
19,51,interviewer,"So is that about getting your chest up, to come through to create that space? Or just lifting yourself away from the obstacle?",101,23
19,52,participant,"I think lifting yourself like the whole body, you know? So just a bit higher from the obstacle.",75,18
19,53,interviewer,"How about with the hips coming up? I've heard some people talk about needing to get their hips pretty high up. Is that something that you think about in konging, or coaching?",138,32
19,54,participant,"Yes, sometimes I point it out when, because I am, I don't know exactly how much you need to have those hips, like high but but it's is a thing that, because you need to have your weight or a really significant amount of your of your weight on your hands. Because then you can push that weight and make that make the space available. So and sometimes beginners tend to be a bit scared to do that. They need to some, or they don't know that there's need to be this kind of more energy into the takeoff to be a bit more higher. So sometimes I pointed out that they can try to focus on that a bit more. Sometimes they that help helps, because they just tried to be a bit higher. And then they we could say like they need to push from those hands, because it's just the one option or they will fall, something like that.",633,162
19,55,interviewer,"You, I think you mentioned when you're talking about the... I've forgotten the phrase, you refer to it as a monkey up, or monkey...?",97,24
19,56,participant,Monkey plants.,12,2
19,57,interviewer,Monkey plant.,11,2
19,58,participant,"I don't know. Yeah, I just, I just heard it.",30,10
19,59,interviewer,"That's all good. Yeah, I mean, like you say, there's names, there's all sorts of names for everything but I just, you know, I want to use the one that you're familiar with. That's all. That, you know, it's to help people get used to the movement without a drop on the other side.",208,54
19,60,participant,Yeah.,4,1
19,61,interviewer,"Is that, you know, do you consider that the movement, particularly maybe as a coach? Is it something that's a bit scary for people to learn?",109,26
19,62,participant,"It's actually for me, as I said, it's actually to get rid of that fear in an actual Kong, because you can do it's actually on the longer obstacles. And you can imagine that if that obstacle is a bit, a bit thinner and you would, and your feet lands in that imaginable space a bit further, then you can say to yourself, I actually can do that over a thin obstacle. So.",282,73
19,63,interviewer,So it's giving people a chance to practice the technique. without worrying about that.,70,14
19,64,participant,"Yeah, without that possible consequences.",35,5
19,65,interviewer,Is that something that you found people might worry about a lot?,52,12
19,66,participant,"Yes, I think so. Because most of the time, they just they're good enough to do the vault. And they quite experienced, experienced for beginners. But there's that there's that something that they don't know how to how to overcome. Because it is kind of different, because there's no other motion that they can kind of avoid that. Because when you have the side vault or lazy vault, you can just go around with it but in the kong vault you just need to push and hope that your feet won't touch on the obstacle.",397,95
19,67,interviewer,Yeah. So there's like a degree of commitment to the movement.,48,11
19,68,participant,Yeah.,4,1
19,69,interviewer,"You know, once you decide to do it, you can't change your mind [laugh]",52,14
19,70,participant,"[laugh] Yeah, exactly.",16,3
19,71,interviewer,Yeah. And then so you mentioned landing as well that you don't worry too much about teaching landings when you're doing kongs.,101,22
19,72,participant,"Yeah like specifically to Kongs, because landings is like a general thing that you need to master but then it is kind of not the point which is just really crucial to the Kong itself.",147,35
19,73,interviewer,"Yeah. So you'd like, if you learn to do a good landing from just a jump, you can just do that from a kong.",78,24
19,74,participant,"Yeah, if you can do good precisions and rolls and if you're just strong enough to do these things, I think that it will just adapt to the vault itself.",118,30
19,75,interviewer,"How about for coming out of a kong, like running? Is that any different? Or is it the same, you just learn how to kind of land and run? I'm thinking if you're trying to connect it to another movement.",153,40
19,76,participant,"Yeah, I know, what you aiming for. Yeah, so um, that's the thing that we teach, or I teach in, basically with any other vault, that there's an option to, to land on both of your feet, or just the one and you can run, then, but I don't think it's something specific that I can teach you somehow to land on that one foot, and you magically will run away. It's just something from your intuition. And it's just something I don't know, if I've ever taught anyone to specifically do anything to, to land on the one foot, but basically, most of the time it is it is almost the same thing. As with the takeoff, so it's a smoother transition to running. So it's just like the starting point.",519,132
19,77,interviewer,"So it's maybe not, you know, exactly. linked to the Kong vault technique itself. It's just kind of what you have to do after doing a kong, but you can learn that for any movement.",137,35
19,78,participant,Yeah.,4,1
19,79,interviewer,"Yeah, I see what you're saying. I mean, having said that, is there anything about the Kong that you have to think about, when you're doing, perhaps the part on the obstacle with your hands, to set you up for a good landing? You know, is or is there a way you can do a Kong where you can have a bad landing?",232,63
19,80,participant,"Yeah, I would say that you can, you can start to have a rotation in the [unclear], or sometimes when the running to the obstacle is slow, or if it is too fast, they, you either go heads forward, or you just try to squeeze yourself, and then you need to arch just to make it over the obstacle. But most of the time, I think it's, it's would, with your speed, like, it corresponds to your speed, because if you're too slow, you need to squeeze yourself in that in that direction somehow to make it and if you too fast, like there's too much energy to handle. So your hips actually actually like make it first nonetheless.",476,119
19,81,interviewer,So you have to kind of gauge the power you put into the vault to make sure it's the right amount for the landing you might be going for?,106,29
19,82,participant,"Um, could you repeat that.",20,5
19,83,interviewer,You need to control the power you put in.,32,9
19,84,participant,"Yeah, yeah, basically. Most of the time it's, it's something that you just teach or you learn through the way like it's it's it's almost the same thing like with precisions you know, when it when you start it's just most the time it's it's either is either too much or not enough and it's that's that gap narrows. So.",241,60
19,85,interviewer,So with practice you can kind of get like a good feel for what you need to do.,60,18
19,86,participant,Yeah.,4,1
19,87,interviewer,"Mm. Talking about learning actually, how, how did you learn the Kong vault? Were you self taught? Did you go to classes or...?",95,23
19,88,participant,"So yeah, I was self taught. It was kind of funny thing because I knew about some of the parkour vaults without actually doing parkour. Because we're just, we just like to chase ourselves in playgrounds and stuff like this. And we had that we had an older friend, who just told us that there is something like lazy vault or something like monkey vault we are, that was a thing for the Kong, back then, for some reason, I didn't know. And, and we just, it was something like, at the time, it was, like, something that was like, like a special skills in the in the chase game, you know, that chase tag that we played, and so everybody in the party just wanted to wanted to wanted to know that. So I would try, I mean, like, hundreds of times, through something through some walls or or anything, and but I, I would be also scared to, to make it too pull, to push that through my hands and to be straight in the motion. So I every time I just done that. I just, I just wished my my legs to decide. And it was kind of kong kind of side vault, something in between and I was just doing it because I just I just fold and hope that one time it will come and, and it just came. So that was the process. And I didn't have or know, any exercises or any other steps that could lead to that success. So I just tried.",999,261
19,89,interviewer,"And then so how did that transition into doing it as a parkour movement? Like, did you see people doing parkour and kind of get involved? Or how did, how did that become you being a parkour coach?",154,38
19,90,participant,"I'm not sure how much this affected my coaching. But actually, I, a lot of times I remember this, this this moment of learning Kong myself, because because I mentioned it a lot of times to the beginners that they can learn it's actually just trying to, to make it make that to make that progress from just doing a side vault and then just try to squeeze those legs, between our hands, just by pushing and trying to, trying the thing basically hundreds of times, but so they can know that it's possible, maybe it's just a motivational thing most time because, you know, it's just like, because many times if they if they cannot somehow understand. It's many times it's just about trying, you know, because sometimes you have every ingredient that you needs, but there's that element of trying if you need to, and I... what was the question again, like how did how did that affect my coaching?",698,162
19,91,interviewer,"Yeah, I mean, so the thing I'm curious about is with coaches, whether they're teaching people the movement, the same way they learnt it, you know, or whether they've kind of updated things over time or changed them?",168,38
19,92,participant,"So yes yeah, I definitely  updated because back then it was just simply trying so right now I'm just trying to analyse it a bit more and help them with those details. If they need it.",143,36
19,93,interviewer,"And did that updating come about just from you thinking, I want to update this or have you learned from any other coaches or anything like that?",116,27
19,94,participant,"There was just I don't know like just trying over and over and trying different techniques like kong to precision, double Kongs, dive Kongs and seeing other people doing them, if there was an opportunity, I would just like consult or just talk about they're views on the on them, there was not like, nothing, nothing specific. No coach or anything like that.",285,63
19,95,interviewer,Just kind of like social interactions just talking to people.,51,10
19,96,participant,Yeah.,4,1
19,97,interviewer,"Yeah, that's, I think that's pretty common for parkour at the moment, you know, we learn from each other.",80,19
19,98,participant,"Yeah, yeah.",8,2
19,99,interviewer,"And kind of pass these things along. Have you seen anyone or heard of any coaching that, like, you thought was really different, or really unique, or that you thought was bad? You know, or have people generally in your experience had like, similar ways of coaching?",210,47
19,100,participant,"I mean, it's hard to think about it most of the time. I know, it's just, from my perspective, is, it's almost every time it's, it's kind of a same thing, but actually, like, just that uniqueness of everybody's approach, like, that's the thing. So, but most of the time, it is appears to me that it is almost the same thing. But sometimes, there's a significant, significant, difference in, in the, in the system of coaching or something. Now, because it's, it's much more different when you're just outside and trying to teach somebody, just because they just asked for it. And it's different when you have a course and the people sign, and you have space and, and time for, for, for the system to create some some sort of system. Yeah.",559,134
19,101,interviewer,"I think you mentioned quite near the start about, you know, the individual, right, you have to kind of coach to individuals, everyone's going to be slightly different. Some people are going to show up and do a kong straightaway, and some people are gonna have to train for like six months-",229,52
19,102,participant,"Yeah, and also, and also it differs from from coach to coach, like, like that, the phrasing the wording and, because what could be a special points in, in some moves, or, for example, in that Kong, for somebody else, it would be something different, you know, those points would be maybe mixed up with a little bit, but overall, I would think that it would be kind of the same thing, or really similar.",310,75
19,103,interviewer,"Yeah, I mean, I kind of view it as there's only so many ways you can teach that movement, right? It's, it's fairly, you know, straightforward, and you kind of need a way, you might make it like you talk about less scary, but it's still the same kind of pattern. Right?",201,52
19,104,participant,Yeah.,4,1
19,105,interviewer,"Are there any, like anything when you're coaching the Kong that you're particularly looking for, and someone doing it to be able to say like, Yes, that was good or no, that was bad? As a coach?",148,37
19,106,participant,"I mean, I just I just try to look at the performance of the one trying it and then try to decide what point is, is the most needed one to improve, so know if if the takeoff is a problem, I will try to make a point that we need to work on the most on the takeoff, or or any other path, so let's try to break it into those pieces and work on those.",262,77
19,107,interviewer,"Are there any any of those that you kind of see a lot, like come up quite commonly for people or is it all just, everyone's individual?",105,27
19,108,participant,"Ah, so yeah, basically, everybody's in, it is individual thing. But most of the time if if I just wants to generalise things, I would say that, that, that the take off is, is problematic. And lots of times, because that's motion that that kind of rhythm that you need to have in order to make that transition is kind of problematic for some reason. And and then that fear from falling because you stumble through the obstacle. These two things I would say.",357,84
19,109,interviewer,"I mean, we talked about fear a little bit already, but just thinking about it again. Is it, is fear something that people have to work on with the Kong? Is that slightly unique to it as a vault? Like, I'm thinking about something like a step vault, I don't see people getting scared of the step vault, in the way that they do the Kong.",258,66
19,110,participant,"Yeah. Yeah, definitely. There's a bit more fear in this. Yeah.",46,11
19,111,interviewer,"I guess because of that, that commitment we talked about.",46,10
19,112,participant,"And if I if I think about it, it's, it's kind of unique in the way because, for example, when you when you do dash vault, I would say that it is even more, like, even scarier than the Kong vault, because you just need to know you have your legs in front of you. So it's, I would say it is scary. This is definitely scarier than the Kong vault. But you can kind of fake it through the lazy vault until it is straight, but and, like the transition is kind of similar with the kong vault from the side vault, but it's not the same for some reason, like the there's this part when a person just needs to go and just do it. Yeah, there's this point that nobody ever avoids. So [laugh]",516,137
19,113,interviewer,"I mean, comparing it still to other vaults. Is there anything like with the Kong vault that it's better at than other vaults? Or worse? Is, is there a reason you would pick a Kong vault over a dash vault, for example, or any other form? Or is it all just like, personal preference? Just what do you want to do.",238,61
19,114,participant,"Maybe most of the time it would be preference, but I don't know it is kind of once you once you're pretty comfortable with the Kong, it's, I think it's a bit more comfortable, comfortable to do that. actually on in harder environments, like the rails and stuff like that, because you see your hands most of the time and you have a clear vision where you are going. So when you do dash vault to the rail, it is kind of scary, because you don't see the rail beneath you, so there's a kind of scary thing. And, and I don't say that it isn't scary to do, for example, dive Kongs over the rails. But you can always scale it up. So it is scary actually.",494,128
19,115,interviewer,"Do you consider the Kong vault to be like, something important for people to learn to do parkour or useful? Or is it like a fundamental parkour movement?",123,28
19,116,participant,"I would say so because it just gives you that just a lot of potential to work with. Because the variations are like there's a lot of them and I think it is good. In this sense. Definitely. Like a lot of potential to, to experiment and to work with. And in the sense of, like, growing as an athlete or as an parkour practitioner. It just, it almost it is almost with every move that you learn because you're more versatile, you're more universal. So it is good for you to to be more comfortable in in many different situations.",410,101
19,117,interviewer,"I guess the flip side to that question is if someone was doing parkour and they didn't like Kongs. Is that okay, is that? Or are they missing out on something?",124,31
19,118,participant,"Like, it's definitely okay. You don't need to do anything that you don't like, but, but the other thing is that it is not that difficult to learn, actually, and it gives you a lot of, so it gives you more in long term, even if you struggle in the beginning, so after, after you, you must say it's at least a bit, it's it gives you a lot of potential. So.",264,72
19,119,interviewer,"I, I realised, as I was saying that it sounded like a trap question [laugh] or something like I'm trying to get you to say something bad about someone not doing something. But yeah, it's it, I guess the reason for that kind of question is, obviously, Parkour is very open. And people can do very different things and still have it be called parkour. So I'm trying, but something like the Kong feels like quite, quite like a foundational movement in parkour, kind of quite a famous, parkour move.",387,90
19,120,participant,"Yes, yes.",6,2
19,121,interviewer,"So I guess I'm just kind of asking people like, how did you kind of fit those two things together in terms of, parkour is open and anything you want it to be, and also we've got this set of like, very specific moves to teach you.",176,47
19,122,participant,"Yeah, this is quite strange, strange combinations, just as you said, because it is kind of a milestone for everybody to reach that in the journey. Like, I just, I just can do a Kong vault now. But I don't know why there's that amount of traction to it. I don't think that I have an answer.",220,57
19,123,interviewer,"I mean, I think what you said about it just being very useful is, is maybe a good reason. Yeah. You know, it's, it's survived, because people have gone yeah, I can use it for this. I can use it for that. And so it's worth learning and teaching. Is that, does that, do you agree with that? Does that sound reasonable to you?",242,64
19,124,participant,"Yeah, I was, I would say so that by learning just a simple move, it gives you, it gives you opportunity to to have a lot of fun, or this do you need to or, you did you can grow that on to make it to another things and other variations that are a bit harder, that you can improve on that you can build on that foundation later on.",252,70
19,125,interviewer,"So we've gone through a lot of questions, I like to try and get to people. Is there anything about the Kong vault that you'd like to know more about? Or that you're curious about? And it's okay, if the answer is no, by the way, it's, it's not to put you on the spot.",197,55
19,126,participant,"I wouldn't like to say no, because it is like I don't know everything and not even about the kong vault. But I would like to, I would like to learn anything new about it. But I don't have anything specific. Like if you can teach me, if anybody can teach me anything new I will be really glad to learn. But I I don't have any specific I guess.",261,70
19,127,interviewer,"Yeah, no, no problem. And is there anything else that you've maybe thought of that we didn't get a chance to talk about or popped into your head or anything else you'd like to add just at the end here?",155,40
19,128,participant,"I don't know maybe if we talk you about that terminology or that feeling of those vaults, as you mentioned that that we see a Kong and we know it is a Kong but it's hard to explain. I sometimes I think about triple Kongs and Quadra Kongs. Because it is a silly thing. But it's sometimes it gets too much hype and and I don't know if it's Kong or it isn't because the technique is sketchy and it's something that [laugh]",324,83
19,129,interviewer,"I mean it's strange, isn't it that these things I mean even things like dive kong and double kong. They have the word Kong in them, but are they the same movement or are they completely different? They share common things right?",180,42
19,130,participant,"Yeah, but I would say that the dive kong and double Kong actually are Kongs, because, like, [unclear] like the dissimilarity is is really there but, but I have the problem with triple Kongs and quadra Kongs in this motion that you either do it just by tapping on the obstacles and do that Kong on the on the last one. So you basically just basically just did a dive Kong but you tap on three other obstacles, or it is just jumping in handstand, because because someone's taking it easy just to push and to make it that way.",412,100
19,131,interviewer,That's really interesting. I hadn't thought about it that way. You're just kicking up into a handstand-,81,17
19,132,participant,Someone just taps and someone is a bit stronger. So he will just jump in the handstand while still having a bit of the speed from from the run up. So.,117,31
19,133,interviewer,"So would you consider the need to kind of have a bit of push in the arms, to be what makes something a Kong?",83,24
19,134,participant,"I would probably say that yes. But but then when you jump in handstand, and you actually do that pushing motion, but you're in handstand and and then it is kind of I don't know that that's why I have the problem with it. So because in double Kong, it is, I think that the technique is really efficient, because you can, you can just make a lot, a lot longer distances with it. Because you if you actually if that if the technique is good, and you use your hands properly, it gives you just a more height and distance. And so it is really efficient. But with triple kongs or quadra kongs, I have this problem. And it's still unsolved that it is it is it Kong or it's not.",517,132
19,135,interviewer,"I guess it's like, we were saying for parkour in general like it. It's, there's no rules. Basically, someone, someone could say that is a kong or triple Kong or whatever. And there's nothing that we can point to be like no, because of this or yes because of this. We just have to kind of, I guess as a community, just kind of agree?",252,65
19,136,participant,Yeah [laugh],9,2
19,137,interviewer,"That's kind of the thing I found really interesting in this kind of research is is how there are there are a lot of things that have just kind of been agreed upon, even though they're unwritten.",154,37
19,138,participant,Yeah. That's really interesting.,26,4
19,139,interviewer,"But yeah, there's there's always these little, little extreme cases. Yes. Yeah, that's pretty interesting. I hadn't thought about that, that you could just go into handstand and just jump.",147,30
19,140,participant,Some guys do that like that.,22,6
19,141,interviewer,"Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I don't know how you'd kind of how you... I suppose momentum? Maybe? If you're just jumping with the hands.",92,24
19,142,participant,"Yeah. Because if you would just do it straight from the handstands, it would be with you would be ridiculously strong for that just to make long jumps, in handstand and so that speed just gives you a, it just is enough force. Yeah, I guess that is still a kind of jumping just from the run up. But you, you're still jumping the handstands. And maybe with the tapping one, it's I would say that it is kind of a variation of double Kong because you do the same technique, but you just need to add just a bit more moves into the movements. So he just he...",428,109
19,143,interviewer,Just reached out as you go over.,25,7
19,144,participant,Yeah.,4,1
19,145,interviewer,"Huh. Yeah, I kind of see what you mean that the double Kong has a very clear like takeoff and not landingexactly but like secondary part with the hands-",121,29
19,146,participant,"Yeah, yeah, yes.",11,3
19,147,interviewer,"Whereas in something like a triple Kong, those, those are the same. It's just there's a little bit in middle. It's whether that bit in the middle of really makes a difference. ",136,32
19,148,participant,"Exactly. I think because in double Kong it actually helps you to make that first contact with with obstacle but then in triple Kong, it's kind of useless. It's just just to make it a bit different, to name it triple or quadruple in, but it's not effective at all. Like double kong is, I guess the peak of that efficiency.",250,61
19,149,interviewer,"Yeah, that's really interesting. Okay, cool. Is there. Is there anything else that you'd like to add or you can think of to the throw in?",104,26
19,150,participant,I don't think so. I don't have anything right now.,37,10
19,151,interviewer,"Cool. Well, I'll stop the recording in that case.",37,9
